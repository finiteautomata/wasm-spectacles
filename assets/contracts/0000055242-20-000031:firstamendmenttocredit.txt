Such Successor Rate for the Applicable Currency shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice; provided, that, to the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent, such Successor Rate for such Applicable Currency shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent.
If no Successor Rate has been determined and the circumstances under clause (a) above exist or the Scheduled Unavailability Date has occurred (as applicable), the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Company and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Loans shall be suspended, (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) the Eurocurrency Rate component shall no longer be utilized in determining the ABR. Upon

8



receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrowers may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Loans (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of ABR Loans (subject to the foregoing clause (y)) in the amount specified therein and (ii) (A) any outstanding affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars will be deemed to have been converted into ABR Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period and (B) any outstanding affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, at the applicable Borrower’s election, shall either (1) be converted into a Borrowing of ABR Loans denominated in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of such outstanding Eurocurrency Rate Loan at the end of the applicable Interest Period or (2) be prepaid at the end of the applicable Interest Period in full; provided, that, if no election is made by the applicable Borrower by the earlier of (x) the date that is three (3) Business Days after receipt by the Company of such notice and (y) the last day of the current Interest Period for the applicable Eurocurrency Rate Loan, the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have elected clause (1) above.
Notwithstanding anything else herein, any definition of Successor Rate shall provide that in no event shall such Successor Rate be less than zero for purposes of this Agreement.
In connection with the implementation of a Successor Rate for any currency, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Successor Rate Conforming Changes with respect to such currency from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Successor Rate Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement; provided, that, with respect to any such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such Successor Conforming Changes for the Applicable Currency to the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective.

Signature on or associated with any Communication shall be valid and binding on such Loan Party to the same extent as a manual, original signature, and that any Communication entered into by Electronic Signature, will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Loan Party enforceable against such in accordance with the terms thereof to the same extent as if a manually executed original signature was delivered. Any Communication may be executed in as many counterparts as necessary or convenient, including both paper and electronic counterparts, but all such counterparts are one and the same Communication. For the avoidance of doubt, the authorization under this Section 9.18 may include use or acceptance by the Administrative Agent and each Lender of a manually signed paper Communication which has been converted into electronic form (such as scanned into PDF format), or an electronically signed Communication converted into another format, for transmission, delivery and/or retention. The Administrative Agent and each Lender may, at its option, create one or more copies of any Communication in the form of an imaged Electronic Record (“Electronic Copy”), which shall be deemed created in the ordinary course of the such Person’s business, and destroy the original paper document. All Communications in the form of an Electronic Record, including an Electronic Copy, shall be considered an original for all purposes, and shall have the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a paper record. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Administrative Agent is under no obligation to accept an Electronic Signature in any form or in any format unless expressly agreed to by the Administrative Agent pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided, that, without limiting the foregoing, (a) to the extent the Administrative Agent has agreed to accept such Electronic Signature, the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be entitled to rely on any such Electronic Signature purportedly given by or on behalf of any Loan Party without further verification and (b) upon the request of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any Electronic Signature shall be promptly followed by such manually executed counterpart.
(cc)    In Section 9.19 of the Credit Agreement, (i) each reference to “EEA Financial Institution” is hereby amended to read “Affected Financial Institution”; (ii) each reference to “an EEA Resolution Authority” is hereby amended to read “the applicable Resolution Authority”; and (iii) the reference to “any EEA Resolution Authority” is hereby amended to read “the applicable Resolution Authority”.
(dd)    A new Section 9.20 is hereby added after Section 9.19 of the Credit Agreement to read as follows:
9.20.    Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs. To the extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for any Hedge Agreement or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, “QFC Credit Support”, and each such QFC, a “Supported QFC”), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the “U.S. Special Resolution Regimes”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States):

12



In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “Covered Party”) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under such U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under such U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.
(ee)    Exhibit E to the Credit Agreement is hereby amended to read in the form of Exhibit E attached hereto and each other Exhibit to the Credit Agreement is hereby amended to replace each reference to “Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited” with “Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Designated Activity Company”.
2.Conditions Precedent. This Agreement shall be effective upon satisfaction of the following conditions precedent:
(a)receipt by the Administrative Agent of counterparts of this agreement duly executed by the Borrowers, the Guarantors, the Required Lenders and the Administrative Agent; and
(b)    the Company shall have paid all fees and other amounts due and payable on or prior to the First Amendment Effective Date pursuant to this Agreement and/or any fee letter entered into in connection with this Agreement, including, to the extent invoiced prior to the First Amendment Effective Date (or such later date as the Company may agree), reimbursement or payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel) required to be reimbursed or paid by the Company in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
3.    Payment of Expenses. The Loan Parties agree to reimburse the Administrative Agent for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement, including the reasonable out-of-pocket fees, disbursements and expenses of counsel to the Administrative Agent.
4.    Miscellaneous.
(a)    Except as set forth in this Agreement, the Loan Documents and the obligations of the Loan Parties thereunder are hereby ratified and confirmed and shall remain in full force and effect according to their terms. This Agreement is a Loan Document.

13



(b)    Each Loan Party (i) acknowledges and consents to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (ii) affirms all of its obligations under the Loan Documents, and (iii) agrees that this Agreement and all documents executed in connection herewith do not operate to reduce or discharge its obligations under the Loan Documents.
(c)    Each Loan Party represents and warrants that: (i) such Loan Party has all requisite power and authority and all requisite governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement; (ii) the execution, delivery and performance by such Loan Party of this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary organizational action, and do not and will not (A) violate any Requirement of Law or any Contractual Obligation of any Group Member and (B) will not result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien on any of their respective properties or revenues pursuant to any Requirement of Law or any such Contractual Obligation; (iii) no consent or authorization of, filing with, notice to or other act by or in respect of, any Governmental Authority or any other Person is required in connection with the execution, delivery, performance, validity or enforceability of this Agreement; (iv) this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by such Loan Party and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Loan Party, enforceable against such Loan Party in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and by general equitable principles (whether enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity or at law); and (v) after giving effect to this Agreement, (A) each of the representations and warranties made by such Loan Party in or pursuant to the Loan Documents (other than the representation and warranty set forth in Section 3.2 of the Credit Agreement) shall be true and correct on and as of the First Amendment Effective Date as if made on and as of the First Amendment Effective Date, and (B) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.
(d)    This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic imagine means (e.g. “pdf” or “tif”) shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. Subject to Section 9.18 of the Credit Agreement (as amended by this Agreement), this Agreement may be in the form of an Electronic Record and may be executed using Electronic Signatures (including facsimile and .pdf) and shall be considered an original and shall have the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a paper record.
(e)    If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (i) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (ii) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
(f)    THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY CLAIMS, CONTROVERSY, DISPUTE OR CAUSE OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE) BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

14



(g)    The terms of Sections 9.12 and 9.15 of the Credit Agreement with respect to submission to jurisdiction, waiver of venue and waiver of jury trial are incorporated herein by reference, mutatis mutandis, and the parties hereto agree to such terms.
