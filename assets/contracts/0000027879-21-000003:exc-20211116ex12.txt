Each holder of a Bond, by its acceptance of a Bond, will be deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to be entitled to the benefits of this Section 20 as though it were a party to this Agreement. On reasonable request by the Company in connection with the delivery to any holder of a Bond of information required to be delivered to such holder under this Agreement or requested by such holder (other than a holder that is a party to this Agreement or its nominee), such holder will enter into an agreement with the Company embodying the provisions of this Section 20. In the event that as a condition to receiving access to information relating to the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, any Purchaser or holder of a Bond is required to agree to a confidentiality undertaking (whether through IntraLinks, another secure website, a secure virtual workspace or otherwise) which is different from this Section 20, this Section 20 shall not be amended thereby and, as between such Purchaser or such holder and the Company, this Section 20 shall supersede any such other confidentiality undertaking.

Upon receipt of such notice, any reference to such Purchaser in this Agreement (other than in this Section 21), shall be deemed to refer to such Substitute Purchaser in lieu of such original Purchaser. In the event that such Substitute Purchaser is so substituted as a Purchaser hereunder and such Substitute Purchaser thereafter transfers to such original Purchaser all of the Bonds then held by such Substitute Purchaser, upon receipt by the Company of notice of such transfer, any reference to such Substitute Purchaser as a “Purchaser” in this Agreement (other than in this Section 21), shall no longer be deemed to refer to such Substitute Purchaser, but shall refer to such original Purchaser, and such original Purchaser shall again have all the rights of an original holder of the Bonds under this Agreement and the other Bond Documents.

Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. Section 22.2. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall (to the full extent permitted by law) not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Section 22.3. Construction.

Each counterpart may consist of a number of copies hereof, each signed by less than all, but together signed by all, of the parties hereto. Section 22.5. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and the rights of the parties shall be governed by, the law of the State of New York excluding choice-of-law principles of the law of such State that would require the application of the laws of a jurisdiction other than such State. Section 22.6. Jurisdiction and Process; Waiver of Jury Trial. (a) Each of the Company and each holder of a Bond irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, but excluding the Bonds or the other Bond Documents. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each of the Company and each holder of a Bond irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, any claim that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court and any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. (b) Nothing in this Section 22.6 shall affect the right of the Company or any holder of a Bond to serve process in any manner permitted by law, or limit any right that the Company or the holders of any of the Bonds may have to bring proceedings against the other in the courts of any appropriate jurisdiction or to enforce in any lawful manner a judgment obtained in one jurisdiction in any other jurisdiction.

(e) THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BROUGHT ON OR WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE BONDS OR ANY OTHER DOCUMENT EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THEREWITH.

Based upon the foregoing and subject to the assumptions, exceptions, limitations and qualifications set forth herein, we are of the opinion that: 1. Based on the Good Standing Certificates, the Company is a corporation organized and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and the Commonwealth of Virginia. 1 To update as necessary

The Bond Purchase Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors’ rights and to general equity principles. 4.

The Bonds are in the form contemplated by the Mortgage and have been duly executed by the Company, and when the Bonds have been (A) duly authenticated and delivered by the Trustee under the Mortgage and (B) issued and delivered by the Company against payment of the purchase price therefor as provided in the Bond Purchase Agreement, the Bonds will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors’ rights and to general equity principles, and will be entitled to the benefits of the Mortgage.
  Exhibit 4.4(a) (to Bond Purchase Agreement) AmericasActive:16117388.7 7. The Delaware Public Service Commission and the Maryland Public Service Commission have each issued an order authorizing the Company to issue and sell the Bonds as contemplated by the Bond Purchase Agreement; such orders are in full force and effect and, to our knowledge, no proceeding has been initiated upon appeal from or to review the effectiveness of such orders. No other consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with, any state commission or regulatory authority or of any federal commission or regulatory authority, or of any other governmental agency or body, is required in connection with the transactions contemplated in the Bond Purchase Agreement, except as may be required under the blue sky or securities laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the purchase and sale of the Bonds by the Purchasers in the manner contemplated in the Bond Purchase Agreement. 8. Based upon and assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement, it is not necessary in connection with the issuance and sale to the Purchasers of the Bonds pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement to register the Bonds under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or to qualify an indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. 9.

We are not representing the Company in any pending litigation, investigation or other proceeding against the Company or any of its properties, or in any litigation, investigation or other proceeding that is overtly threatened in writing against it or any of its properties by a potential claimant, that challenges the validity or enforceability of, or seeks to enjoin the performance of, the Bond Purchase Agreement, the Mortgage or the Bonds. We do not have knowledge of any litigation or governmental proceeding that is pending or threatened in writing against the Company that is required to be disclosed in the 34 Act Filings, other than those proceedings referred to in the 34 Act Filings. The foregoing opinions are subject to the following exceptions, limitations and qualifications: (a) We express no opinion herein as to: (a) whether any particular property is owned by the Company, (b) whether any property owned by the Company is subject to or affected by liens or encumbrances other than the Mortgage or (c) the priority of the lien of the Mortgage.

  Exhibit 4.4(b) (to Bond Purchase Agreement) AmericasActive:16117388.7 EXHIBIT 4.4(b) FORM OF OPINION OF ASSISTANT GENERAL COUNSEL OF THE COMPANY The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee 101 Barclay Street New York, New York 10286 The Purchasers of Delmarva Power & Light Company First Mortgage Bonds, 3.06% SERIES DUE FEBRUARY 15, 2052 named in Schedule I attached hereto Re: Delmarva Power & Light Company $125,000,000 First Mortgage Bonds, 3.06% SERIES DUE FEBRUARY 15, 2052 Ladies and Gentlemen: I am Assistant General Counsel and Assistant Secretary for Delmarva Power & Light Company (as successor to Delaware Power & Light Company) (the “Company”). This opinion is furnished by me in connection with the issuance by the Company of $125,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of First Mortgage Bonds, 3.06% SERIES DUE FEBRUARY 15, 2052 (the “Securities”) to be issued under and secured by the Mortgage and Deed of Trust, dated as of October 1, 1943, between the Company and The New York Trust Company, as trustee, to which The Bank of New York Mellon, a New York banking corporation, is successor trustee (the “Trustee”), as amended and supplemented by the indentures supplemental thereto, including the Supplemental Indenture, dated as of February [•], 2022 (the “Supplemental Indenture”), relating to the issuance of the Securities (such Mortgage and Deed of Trust, as so amended and supplemented, the “Mortgage”). I understand that the Company has applied to the Trustee for the authentication and delivery of the Securities on the basis of bondable value of property additions as provided in Section 4.03 of the Mortgage and bonds that have been previously cancelled as provided in Section 4.05 of the Mortgage. I am familiar with the steps taken or caused to be taken by the Company in connection with the Company’s request to the Trustee to authenticate and deliver the Securities. I, or competent attorneys in whom I have confidence (“my representatives”), have examined documents and proceedings in connection therewith, including: A. the Restated Certificate and Articles of Incorporation of the Company as were duly filed in each of the State of Delaware and the Commonwealth of Virginia (the “Charter”); B. the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company, as last amended and effective April 5, 2005;
  Exhibit 4.4(b) (to Bond Purchase Agreement) AmericasActive:16117388.7 C. resolutions adopted by actions of unanimous written consent of the Board of Directors of the Company dated [•], 2021 relating to this matter; D. the Mortgage and Deed of Trust; E. the Supplemental Indenture; F. the Company Order of even date herewith for the authentication and delivery of the Securities; G. the Order of the Delaware Public Service Commission dated [•], 20[•] and the Order of the Maryland Public Service Commission dated [•], 20[•]; and H. specimens of the Securities. I am, or my representatives are, familiar with and have examined the Officers’ Certificates furnished to you by the Company pursuant to Sections 3.01, 4.05(b) and 4.07(d) of the Mortgage, the Officer’s Certificate of Bondable Value of Property Additions furnished to you pursuant to Section 3.01, Section 4.03 and Paragraph B of Section 1.05 of the Mortgage (the “Bondable Property Addition Certificate”), and the Net Earnings Certificate furnished to you pursuant to Sections 1.06, 3.01, 4.03(c), 4.05(d) and 4.08 of the Mortgage. Based upon the foregoing, I advise you that in my opinion: 1. The issuance of the Securities will not cause the limit of indebtedness of the Company permitted by law or the Mortgage to be exceeded. 2. The issuance of the Securities has been duly authorized by the Company. 3. The issuance of the Securities has been authorized, approved and consented to by all governmental bodies and authorities whose authorization, approval or consent is required for the legal issuance of the Securities. 4. When the Securities shall have been executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company, the Securities will be legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company and will be secured by the lien of the Mortgage. 5. No further instrument, action, recording or filing is necessary to subject to the lien of the Mortgage all the right, title, and interest of the Company in and to the property described in the Bondable Property Addition Certificate. The Company has title to such property constituting such property additions and the Mortgage constitutes a lien upon such property of the Company (except property which has been retired) subject to no defect in title and subject to no lien thereon prior to the lien of the Mortgage, except prior liens and excepted encumbrances, as such terms are defined in the Mortgage. The Company has corporate authority and all
  Exhibit 4.4(b) (to Bond Purchase Agreement) AmericasActive:16117388.7 necessary permission from governmental authorities to acquire, own and operate the property constituting such property additions. No consent or approval of any governmental authority is requisite to the acquisition, ownership or operation of such property additions. 6. All conditions precedent to (i) the execution and delivery by the Trustee of the Supplemental Indenture provided for in the Mortgage (excluding Supplemental Indenture) (including all covenants compliance with which constitutes a condition precedent) and (ii) the authentication and delivery of the Securities provided for in the Mortgage (including all covenants compliance with which constitutes a condition precedent), have been complied with. 7. There are no prior lien bonds described in clause B.3 of the Statement of Net Earnings for the 12 months ending December 31, 2020. This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.4(b) of the Bond Purchase Agreement, dated as of November 16, 2021, by and among the Company and the Purchasers named in Schedule I attached hereto and paragraph (C)(4) of Section 1.05, the third paragraph of Section 3.01, and paragraph (e) of Section 4.07, as evidence of compliance with the covenants and conditions contained therein and in Sections 1.05, 1.06, 4.03, 4.05, 4.07 and 4.08 of the Mortgage and the other pertinent provisions of the Mortgage, which sections and other pertinent provisions of the Mortgage I, or my representatives, have read. In my opinion, I, or my representatives, have made such examination and investigation as is necessary to enable me to express an informed opinion as to whether or not such covenants and conditions have been complied with and, in my opinion, such conditions and covenants have been complied with. With respect to the Company’s real property ownership and the rank of the lien of the Mortgage thereon, I have made no examination of record titles and have relied upon opinions of counsel and abstracts, reports and policies of title companies rendered or issued at or subsequent to the time of acquisition of such property by the Company as well as certificates of officers of the Company, and, in my opinion, you and I are justified in relying thereon. The statements contained in this opinion are based upon my personal investigation or upon investigation by my representatives. Insofar as my opinion relates to factual matters, information with respect to which is in possession of the Company, it is based upon certificates, opinions, and representations by officers of the Company. Very Truly Yours, Brian J. Buck Assistant General Counsel and Assistant Secretary

In rendering the opinions set forth herein, we have examined: (i) the Bond Purchase Agreement; (ii) the Bonds; (iii) the Mortgage and Deed of Trust; (iv) the Supplemental Indenture (the items identified in clauses (i) through (iv) are collectively hereinafter referred to as the “Transaction Documents”); and such other agreements, instruments and documents, and such questions of law as we have deemed necessary or appropriate to enable us to render the opinions expressed below. Additionally, we have examined originals or copies, certified to our satisfaction, of such certificates of public officials and officers of the Issuer, and we have made such inquiries of officers of the Issuer as we have deemed relevant or necessary, as the basis for the opinions set forth herein. As to questions of fact material to such opinions we have, when relevant facts were not independently established, relied upon the representations made in the Bond Purchase
  Exhibit 4.4(c) (to Bond Purchase Agreement) AmericasActive:16117388.7 Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and upon certifications made by officers and other representatives of the Issuer. In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have, with your consent, assumed (i) that the Transaction Documents have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by each party thereto, (ii) that each Transaction Document (other than the Bond Purchase Agreement) is a valid and binding obligation of the Issuer enforceable against the Issuer in accordance with its terms, (iii) that the consummation of the transactions contemplated in the Transaction Documents has been duly authorized by the Issuer, (iv) the legal capacity of all natural persons executing documents, (v) that the signatures of persons signing all documents in connection with which this opinion letter is rendered are genuine, (vi) that all documents submitted to us as originals or duplicate originals are authentic and (vii) that all documents submitted to us as copies, whether certified or not, conform to authentic original documents.

Based upon the foregoing and subject to the qualifications, limitations and comments stated herein, we are of the opinion that: 1. The Bond Purchase Agreement constitutes the valid and binding obligations of the Issuer and is enforceable against the Issuer in accordance with its terms. 2. It was not necessary in connection with the offering, issuance, sale and delivery of the Bonds, under the circumstances contemplated by the Bond Purchase Agreement, to register said Bonds under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or to qualify an indenture in respect of said Bonds under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. 3. Neither the execution or delivery by the Issuer of the Transaction Documents nor the performance by the Issuer of its obligations thereunder requires the consent or approval of, or any filing or registration with, any governmental body, agency or authority of the State of New York or the United States of America other than any consents, approvals or filings required in
  Exhibit 4.4(c) (to Bond Purchase Agreement) AmericasActive:16117388.7 connection with the exercise by any Purchaser of certain remedies under the Transaction Documents to the extent required pursuant to the terms thereof. 4.
