In the case of Revolving Loans, Term Loans and/or Incremental Term Loans, the Borrower Representative, on behalf of any Borrower, shall give written notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed in writing) substantially in the form of Schedule 2.2(a)(i) (each a “Notice of Loan Borrowing”) to the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 Noon (x) on the Business Day of the requested advance in the case of Base Rate Loans, (y) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the requested advance in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars and (z) on the fourth Business Day (or fifth Business Day, in the case of a Special Notice Currency) prior to the date of the requested advance in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies. Each such Notice of Loan Borrowing shall be irrevocable and shall specify (i) that Revolving Loans, Term Loans and/or Incremental Term Loans are requested, (ii) the date of the requested advance (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the aggregate principal amount of Loans requested, (iv) whether the Loans requested shall consist of Base Rate Loans, Eurocurrency Rate Loans or a combination thereof, (v) if Eurocurrency Rate Loans are requested, the Interest Periods with respect thereto, (vi) if Revolving Loans are requested, the currency of the Revolving Loans to be borrowed, and (vii) the applicable Borrower. The Administrative Agent shall as promptly as practicable give each Bank notice of each
  43 CHAR1\1534998v8 requested Loan advance, of such Bank’s pro rata share thereof and of the other matters covered in the Notice of Loan Borrowing. Each Bank shall make the amount of its Loan available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the Administrative Agent’s Office for the applicable currency not later than 2:00 p.m., in the case of any Loan denominated in Dollars, and not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of any Revolving Loan denominated in an Alternative Currency, in each case on the Business Day specified in the applicable Notice of Loan Borrowing. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 5, the Administrative Agent shall, not later than 2:30 p.m. on such Business Day specified in the applicable Notice of Loan Borrowing in the case of a Loan denominated in Dollars and on the same Business Day specified in the applicable Notice of Loan Borrowing in the case of a Revolving Loan denominated in an Alternative Currency, make all funds so received available to the applicable Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent either by (A) crediting the account of such Borrower on the books of Wells Fargo with the amount of such funds or (B) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the Borrower Representative. (ii) Swingline Loans. Each Borrowing of Swingline Loans shall be made upon the Borrower Representative’s irrevocable notice to the Swingline Bank and the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone. Each such notice must be received by the Swingline Bank and the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 Noon on the requested borrowing date, and shall specify (i) the amount to be borrowed, which shall be a minimum principal amount of $250,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof, (ii) whether the Swingline Loans requested shall consist of Base Rate Loans, Daily LIBOR Swingline Loans or a combination thereof, (iii) the requested borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day, and (iv) the applicable U.S. Borrower.

Promptly after receipt by the Swingline Bank of any telephonic Notice of Swingline Loan Borrowing, the Swingline Bank will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has also received such Notice of Swingline Loan Borrowing and, if not, the Swingline Bank will notify the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof. Unless the Swingline Bank has received notice (by telephone or in writing) from the Administrative Agent (including at the request of any Revolving Bank) prior to 1:00 p.m. on the date of the proposed Borrowing of Swingline Loans (A) directing the Swingline Bank not to make such Swingline Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the first proviso to the first sentence of Section 2.1(b), or (B) that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 5 is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swingline Bank will, not later than 1:30 p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such Notice of Swingline Loan Borrowing, make the amount of its Swingline Loan available to the U.S. Borrowers. (iii) Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; Auto- Extension Letters of Credit. (A) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of the Borrower Representative delivered to an Issuing Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit
  44 CHAR1\1534998v8 Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower Representative. Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by the applicable Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. at least three Business Days (or such later date and time as the Administrative Agent and such Issuing Bank may agree in a particular instance in their sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Bank: (1) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (2) the amount thereof; (3) the expiry date thereof; (4) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (5) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (6) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (7) the purpose and nature of the requested Letter of Credit; (8) the currency requested (and in the absence of specification of currency shall be deemed a request for a Letter of Credit denominated in Dollars); and (9) such other matters as such Issuing Bank may require. In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Bank: (I) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (II) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (III) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (IV) such other matters as such Issuing Bank may require. Additionally, the Borrower Representative shall furnish to the applicable Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent such other documents and information pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit issuance or amendment, including any LOC Documents, as such Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent may require. The Borrowers’ Obligations in respect of each Existing Letter of Credit, and each Revolving Bank’s participation obligations in connection therewith, shall be governed by the terms of this Credit Agreement. The Existing Letters of Credit shall, as of the Closing Date, be deemed to have been issued as Letters of Credit hereunder and subject to and governed by the terms of this Credit Agreement. (B) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application in connection with a Letter of Credit to be issued or amended, as the case may be, by an Issuing Bank, such Issuing Bank will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Application from the Borrower Representative and, if not, such Issuing Bank will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Revolving Bank shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the applicable Issuing Bank a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Revolving Bank’s Revolving Commitment Percentage times the amount of such Letter of Credit. (C) If the Borrower Representative so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, an Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an “Auto- Extension Letter of Credit”); provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit such Issuing Bank to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the
  45 CHAR1\1534998v8 “Non-Extension Notice Date”) in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the applicable Issuing Bank, the Borrower Representative shall not be required to make a specific request to such Issuing Bank for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Revolving Banks shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the applicable Issuing Bank to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date; provided, however, that such Issuing Bank shall not permit any such extension if (1) such Issuing Bank has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of clause (ii) or (iii) of Section 2.1(c) or otherwise), or (2) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (I) from the Administrative Agent that the Required Revolving Banks have elected not to permit such extension or (II) from the Administrative Agent, any Revolving Bank or the Borrower Representative that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 5.2 is not then satisfied, and in each case directing such Issuing Bank not to permit such extension. (D) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit issued by an Issuing Bank or any amendment to a Letter of Credit issued by an Issuing Bank to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, such Issuing Bank will also deliver to the Borrower Representative and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment. (b) Minimum Amounts. Each Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall be in a minimum aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Each Base Rate Loan (other than a Base Rate Loan comprising a Swingline Loan) shall be in a minimum aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 (or, if less, the remaining amount of the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount) and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. (c) Information Not Provided. If in connection with any request for a Loan, the Borrower Representative shall fail to specify (i) an applicable Interest Period in the case of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan, the Borrower Representative shall be deemed to have requested an Interest Period of one month, (ii) the currency of the Loans to be borrowed, then the Loans so requested shall be denominated in Dollars, or (iii) the type of loan requested, the Borrower Representative shall be deemed to have requested a Base Rate Loan. If in connection with any request for a Swingline Loan, the Borrower Representative shall fail to specify the type of Swingline Loan requested, then such notice shall be deemed to be a request for a Base Rate Loan. (d) Maximum Number of Eurocurrency Rate Loans. The Revolving Loans may be comprised of no more than seven (7) Eurocurrency Rate Loans outstanding at any time. The Term Loans may be comprised of no more than seven (7) Eurocurrency Rate Loans outstanding at any time. The Incremental Term Loans under any Incremental Term Facility may be comprised of no more than seven (7) Eurocurrency Rate Loans outstanding at any time.

(c) Incremental Term Loans. The outstanding principal amount of all Incremental Term Loans shall be due and payable in the installments, on the dates and in the amounts set forth in the applicable Incremental Term Joinder Agreement for such Incremental Term Loans (as such installments may hereafter be adjusted as a result of the application of prepayments in accordance with the order of priority set forth in Section 3.4), unless accelerated sooner pursuant to Section 9.2. (d) Swingline Loans. The outstanding principal amount of each Swingline Loan shall be due and payable on the earlier to occur of (i) the date required pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and (ii) the Revolving Termination Date. 2.5 Notes. The Loans shall, at the request of a Bank, be evidenced by a Note. 2.6 Additional Provisions relating to Letters of Credit. (a) Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations. (i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of drawing under such Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank shall notify the Borrower Representative and the Administrative Agent thereof. In the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the Borrowers shall reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank in such Alternative Currency, unless (A) such Issuing Bank (at its option) shall have specified in such notice that it will require reimbursement in Dollars, or (B) in the absence of any such requirement for reimbursement in Dollars, the Borrowers shall have notified such Issuing Bank promptly following receipt of the notice of drawing that the Borrowers will reimburse such Issuing Bank in Dollars. In the case of any such reimbursement in Dollars of a drawing under a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the applicable Issuing Bank shall notify the Borrower Representative of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the drawing promptly following the determination thereof. Not later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of any payment by the applicable Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in Dollars, or the Applicable Time on the date of any payment by such Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit
  48 CHAR1\1534998v8 to be reimbursed in an Alternative Currency (each such date, an “Honor Date”), the Borrowers shall reimburse such Issuing Bank through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing and in the applicable currency. If the Borrowers fail to so reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Bank of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (expressed in Dollars in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent thereof in the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency) (the “Unreimbursed Amount”), and the amount of such Revolving Bank’s Revolving Commitment Percentage thereof. In such event, the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Borrowing of Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.2(b) for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 (other than the delivery of a Notice of Loan Borrowing). Any notice given by an Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.6(a)(i) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. (ii) Each Revolving Bank shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.6(a)(i) make funds available (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral provided for this purpose) for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, in Dollars, at the Administrative Agent’s Office for Dollar-denominated payments in an amount equal to its Revolving Commitment Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent which date will not be earlier than the Business Day following the Honor Date, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.1(c)(ii), each Revolving Bank that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the applicable Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the applicable Issuing Bank in Dollars. (iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Borrowing of Revolving Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the applicable Issuing Bank an LOC Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which LOC Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each Revolving Bank’s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.6(a)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such LOC Borrowing and shall constitute an LOC Advance from such Revolving Bank in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.6. (iv) Until each Revolving Bank funds its Revolving Loan or LOC Advance pursuant to this Section 2.6(a) to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Revolving Bank’s Revolving Commitment Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank. (v) Each Revolving Bank’s obligation to make Revolving Loans or LOC Advances to reimburse an Issuing Bank for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.6(a), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Revolving Bank may have against such Issuing Bank, the
  49 CHAR1\1534998v8 Borrowers or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Revolving Bank’s obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.6(a) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 (other than delivery by the Borrower Representative of a Notice of Loan Borrowing). No such making of an LOC Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrowers to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for the amount of any payment made by such Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein. (vi) If any Revolving Bank fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Issuing Bank any amount required to be paid by such Revolving Bank pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.6(a) by the time specified in Section 2.6(a)(ii), then, without limiting the other provisions of this Credit Agreement, such Issuing Bank shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Bank (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such Issuing Bank at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by such Issuing Bank in connection with the foregoing. If such Revolving Bank pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Revolving Bank’s Revolving Loan included in the relevant Borrowing or LOC Advance in respect of the relevant LOC Borrowing, as the case may be. A certificate of an Issuing Bank submitted to any Revolving Bank (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (b) Repayment of Participations. (i) At any time after any Issuing Bank has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Revolving Bank such Revolving Bank’s LOC Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.6(a), if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of such Issuing Bank any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrowers or otherwise, including proceeds of cash collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Revolving Bank its Revolving Commitment Percentage thereof in Dollars and in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent. (ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of an Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.6(a)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.2(b) (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by such Issuing Bank in its discretion), each Revolving Bank shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank its Revolving Commitment Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Revolving Bank, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Revolving Banks under this clause shall survive the termination of the Aggregate Commitments, the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Credit Agreement.
  50 CHAR1\1534998v8 (c) Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrowers to reimburse each Issuing Bank for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each LOC Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Credit Agreement under all circumstances, including the following: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document; (ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that any Credit Party or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), such Issuing Bank or any other Person, whether in connection with this Credit Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction; (iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit; (iv) any payment by such Issuing Bank under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by such Issuing Bank under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; (v) any adverse change in the relevant exchange rates or in the availability of the relevant Alternative Currency to any member of the Consolidated Group or in the relevant currency markets generally; or (vi) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Credit Party or any Subsidiary. The Borrowers shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with the Borrower Representative’s instructions or other irregularity, the Borrowers will immediately notify the applicable Issuing Bank. The Borrowers shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the applicable Issuing Bank and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid. (d) Role of Issuing Bank. Each Revolving Bank and the Borrowers agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, an Issuing Bank shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by such Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of any Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent,
  51 CHAR1\1534998v8 participant or assignee of any Issuing Bank shall be liable to any Revolving Bank for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Revolving Banks or the Required Revolving Banks, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or LOC Document. The Borrowers hereby assume all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrowers’ pursuing such rights and remedies as they may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the Issuing Banks, the Administrative Agent, the Revolving Banks, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the Issuing Banks shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (vi) of Section 2.6(c); provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrowers may have a claim against an Issuing Bank, and such Issuing Bank may be liable to the Borrowers, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrowers which the Borrowers prove were caused by such Issuing Bank’s willful misconduct or gross negligence or such Issuing Bank’s willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Issuing Banks may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the Issuing Banks shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. (e) Applicability of ISP. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the applicable Issuing Bank and the Borrowers when a Letter of Credit is issued (including any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit), the rules of the ISP shall apply to each Letter of Credit. (f) Standby Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Bank in accordance with its Revolving Commitment Percentage a Letter of Credit fee (the “Standby Letter of Credit Fee”) in Dollars for each standby Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable Percentage times the Dollar Equivalent of the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit; provided, however, any Standby Letter of Credit Fees otherwise payable for the account of a Defaulting Bank with respect to any Letter of Credit as to which such Defaulting Bank has not provided Cash Collateral satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 2.6 shall be payable, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, to the other Revolving Banks in accordance with the upward adjustments in their respective Revolving Commitment Percentages allocable to such Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 3.18(a)(iv), with the balance of such fee, if any, payable to such Issuing Bank for its own account. For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.4. Standby Letter of Credit Fees shall be (i) due and payable on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand and (ii) computed on a quarterly basis in arrears. If there is any change in the Applicable Percentage during any quarter, the daily amount available to be drawn under each Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Percentage separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Percentage was in effect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, upon the request of the Required Revolving Banks, while any Event of Default exists, all Standby Letter of Credit Fees shall accrue at the Default Rate.
  52 CHAR1\1534998v8 (g) Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to Issuing Bank. The Borrowers shall pay directly to (i) Bank of America, in its capacity as an Issuing Bank, for its own account, a fronting fee in Dollars with respect to each Letter of Credit issued by Bank of America, at the rate per annum specified in the Bank of America Fee Letter, computed on the Dollar Equivalent of the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit and on a quarterly basis in arrears, and (ii) each other Issuing Bank, a fronting fee with respect to each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank at a rate separately agreed between such Issuing Bank and the Borrower Representative. Such fronting fees shall be due and payable on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December in respect of the most recently-ended quarterly period (or portion thereof, in the case of the first payment), commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. For purposes of computing the Dollar Equivalent of the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.4, but without giving effect to automatic increases in the stated amount not in effect at such time. In addition, the Borrowers shall pay directly to each Issuing Bank for its own account, in Dollars, the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of each Issuing Bank relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable. (h) Conflict with LOC Documents. In the event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any LOC Document, including the Existing Letters of Credit, the terms hereof shall control. (i) Letters of Credit Issued for the Parent or Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations of, or is for the account of, the Parent or a Subsidiary, the Borrowers shall be obligated to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank hereunder for any and all drawings under such Letter of Credit. Each Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of the Parent or such Borrower’s Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of such Borrower, and that the Borrowers’ businesses derive substantial benefits from the businesses of the Parent and the Borrowers’ respective Subsidiaries. (j) Reports. Each Issuing Bank will provide to the Administrative Agent at least quarterly, and more frequently upon request, a detailed summary report on all Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank and the activity thereon, in form and substance acceptable to the Administrative Agent. Each Issuing Bank will provide copies of the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank to the Administrative Agent and the Revolving Banks promptly upon request. (k) Additional Issuing Banks. Any Revolving Bank hereunder may become an Issuing Bank upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent evidencing such Revolving Bank’s agreement with the Borrower Representative to become an Issuing Bank hereunder. 2.7 Additional Provisions relating to Swingline Loans. (a) Refinancing of Swingline Loans. (i) The Swingline Bank at any time in its sole and absolute discretion may request, on behalf of the U.S. Borrowers (which hereby irrevocably authorize the Swingline Bank to so request on its behalf), that each Revolving Bank make a Revolving Loan that is
  53 CHAR1\1534998v8 a Base Rate Loan in an amount equal to such Revolving Bank’s Revolving Commitment Percentage of the amount of Swingline Loans then outstanding. Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Notice of Loan Borrowing for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.2, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 (other than the delivery of a Notice of Loan Borrowing) and provided that, after giving effect to such Borrowing, the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Obligations shall not exceed the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount. The Swingline Bank shall furnish the Borrower Representative with a copy of the applicable Notice of Loan Borrowing promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Revolving Bank shall make an amount equal to its Revolving Commitment Percentage of the amount specified in such Notice of Loan Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral available with respect to the applicable Swingline Loan) for the account of the Swingline Bank at the Administrative Agent’s Office for Dollar- denominated payments not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day specified in such Notice of Loan Borrowing, whereupon, subject to Section 2.7(a)(ii), each Revolving Bank that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Revolving Loan that is a Base Rate Loan to the applicable U.S. Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swingline Bank. (ii) If for any reason any Swingline Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Borrowing of Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.7(a)(i), the request for Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans submitted by the Swingline Bank as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swingline Bank that each of the Revolving Banks fund its risk participation in the relevant Swingline Loan and each Revolving Bank’s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Bank pursuant to Section 2.7(a)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation. (iii) If any Revolving Bank fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Bank any amount required to be paid by such Revolving Bank pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.7(a) by the time specified in Section 2.7(a)(i), the Swingline Bank shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Bank (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swingline Bank at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Swingline Bank in connection with the foregoing. If such Revolving Bank pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Revolving Bank’s Revolving Loan included in the relevant Borrowing or funded participation in the relevant Swingline Loan, as the case may be. A certificate of the Swingline Bank submitted to any Revolving Bank (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (iii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (iv) Each Revolving Bank’s obligation to make Revolving Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this Section 2.7(a) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such Revolving Bank may have against the Swingline Bank, the U.S. Borrowers or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C)
  54 CHAR1\1534998v8 any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Revolving Bank’s obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.7(a) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 5.2. No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the U.S. Borrowers to repay Swingline Loans, together with interest as provided herein. (b) Repayment of Participations. (i) At any time after any Revolving Bank has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swingline Loan, if the Swingline Bank receives any payment on account of such Swingline Loan, the Swingline Bank will distribute to such Revolving Bank its Revolving Commitment Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by the Swingline Bank. (ii) If any payment received by the Swingline Bank in respect of principal or interest on any Swingline Loan is required to be returned by the Swingline Bank under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.2(b) (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swingline Bank in its discretion), each Revolving Bank shall pay to the Swingline Bank its Revolving Commitment Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate. The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of the Swingline Bank. The obligations of the Revolving Banks under this clause shall survive the termination of the Aggregate Commitments, the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Credit Agreement. (c) Interest for Account of Swingline Bank. The Swingline Bank shall be responsible for invoicing the U.S. Borrowers for interest on the Swingline Loans. Until each Revolving Bank funds its Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans or risk participation pursuant to this Section 2.7 to refinance such Revolving Bank’s Revolving Commitment Percentage of any Swingline Loan, interest in respect of such Revolving Commitment Percentage shall be solely for the account of the Swingline Bank. (d) Payments Directly to Swingline Bank. The U.S. Borrowers shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swingline Loans directly to the Swingline Bank. 2.8 Joint and Several Liability of the Borrowers. (a) Each of the Borrowers is accepting joint and several liability hereunder in consideration of the financial accommodation to be provided by the Banks under this Credit Agreement, for the mutual benefit, directly and indirectly, of each of the Borrowers and in consideration of the undertakings of each of the Borrowers to accept joint and several liability for the obligations of each of them. (b) Each of the Borrowers jointly and severally hereby irrevocably and unconditionally accepts, not merely as a surety but also as a co-debtor, joint and several liability with the other Borrowers with respect to the payment and performance of all of the Obligations arising under this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents, it being the intention of the parties hereto that all the Obligations shall be the joint and several obligations of each of the Borrowers without preferences or distinction among them.
  55 CHAR1\1534998v8 (c) If and to the extent that any Borrower shall fail to make any payment with respect to any of the obligations hereunder as and when due or to perform any of such obligations in accordance with the terms thereof, then in each such event, the other Borrowers will make such payment with respect to, or perform, such obligation. (d) The obligations of each Borrower under the provisions of this Section 2.8 constitute full recourse obligations of such Borrower, enforceable against it to the full extent of its properties and assets, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of this Credit Agreement or any other circumstances whatsoever. (e) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each Borrower hereby waives notice of acceptance of its joint and several liability, notice of occurrence of any Default or Event of Default (except to the extent notice is expressly required to be given pursuant to the terms of this Credit Agreement), or of any demand for any payment under this Credit Agreement (except to the extent demand is expressly required to be given pursuant to the terms of this Credit Agreement), notice of any action at any time taken or omitted by the Banks under or in respect of any of the Obligations hereunder, any requirement of diligence and, generally, all demands, notices and other formalities of every kind in connection with this Credit Agreement. Each Borrower hereby assents to, and waives notice of, any extension or postponement of the time for the payment of any of the Obligations hereunder, the acceptance of any partial payment thereon, any waiver, consent or other action or acquiescence by the Banks at any time or times in respect of any default by any Borrower in the performance or satisfaction of any term, covenant, condition or provision of this Credit Agreement, any and all other indulgences whatsoever by the Banks in respect of any of the Obligations hereunder, and the taking, addition, substitution or release, in whole or in part, at any time or times, of any security for any of such Obligations or the addition, substitution or release, in whole or in part, of any Borrower. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Borrower assents to any other action or delay in acting or any failure to act on the part of the Bank, including, without limitation, any failure strictly or diligently to assert any right or to pursue any remedy or to comply fully with applicable laws or regulations thereunder which might, but for the provisions of this Section 2.8, afford grounds for terminating, discharging or relieving such Borrower, in whole or in part, from any of its obligations under this Section 2.8, it being the intention of each Borrower that, so long as any of the Obligations hereunder remain unsatisfied, the obligations of such Borrower under this Section 2.8 shall not be discharged except by performance and then only to the extent of such performance. The obligations of each Borrower under this Section 2.8 shall not be diminished or rendered unenforceable by any winding up, reorganization, arrangement, liquidation, reconstruction or similar proceeding with respect to any reconstruction or similar proceeding with respect to any Borrower or any Bank. The joint and several liability of the Borrowers hereunder shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any absorption, merger, amalgamation or any other change whatsoever in the name, membership, constitution or place of formation of any Borrower or any Bank. (f) The provisions of this Section 2.8 are made for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks, the Swingline Bank, the Banks and their respective successors and assigns, and may be enforced by any such Person from time to time against any of the Borrowers as often as occasion therefor may arise and without requirement on the part of any Bank first to marshal any of its claims or to exercise any of its rights against any of the other Borrowers or to exhaust any remedies available to it against any of the other Borrowers or to resort to any other source or means of obtaining payment of any of the Obligations or to elect any other remedy. The provisions of this Section 2.8 shall remain in effect until all the Obligations hereunder shall have been paid in full or otherwise fully satisfied. If at any time, any payment, or any part thereof, made in respect of any of the Obligations, is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the
  56 CHAR1\1534998v8 Banks upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any of the Borrowers, or otherwise, the provisions of this Section 2.8 will forthwith be reinstated and in effect as though such payment had not been made. (g) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in any other of the Credit Documents, (i) the obligations of each Borrower under this Section 2.8 shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render its obligations under this Section 2.8 subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provisions of any applicable state law, (ii) no Foreign Borrower shall be obligated with respect to any Obligations of any U.S. Borrower, (iii) the Obligations owed by the Foreign Borrowers shall be several and not joint with the Obligations of the U.S. Borrowers and the Guarantors, and (iv) no Foreign Borrower shall be liable for any Obligations of any U.S. Borrower or Guarantor, and all amounts required to be paid by any Foreign Borrower under this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document shall be applied only to Obligations of Foreign Borrowers and shall not be applied to any Obligations of any U.S. Borrower or Guarantor. 2.9 Appointment of the Parent as Legal Representative for Credit Parties. Each of the Credit Parties hereby appoints the Parent to act as its exclusive legal representative for all purposes under this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents (including, without limitation, with respect to all matters related to Borrowings and the repayment of Loans and amounts drawn under Letters of Credit as described in Section 2 and Section 3 hereof) (in such capacity, the “Borrower Representative”). Each of the Credit Parties acknowledges and agrees that (a) the Borrower Representative may execute such documents on behalf of all the Credit Parties (whether as Borrowers or Guarantors) as the Borrower Representative deems appropriate in its reasonable discretion and each Credit Party shall be bound by and obligated by all of the terms of any such document executed by the Borrower Representative on its behalf, (b) any notice or other communication delivered by the Administrative Agent or any Bank hereunder to the Borrower Representative shall be deemed to have been delivered to each of the Credit Parties and (c) the Administrative Agent and each of the Banks shall accept (and shall be permitted to rely on) any document or agreement executed by the Borrower Representative on behalf of the Credit Parties (or any of them). The Borrowers must act through the Borrower Representative for all purposes under this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, to the extent any provision in this Credit Agreement requires any Credit Party to interact in any manner with the Administrative Agent or the Banks, such Credit Party shall do so through the Borrower Representative. 2.10 Incremental Facilities. The Borrowers may at any time and from time to time prior to the Revolving Termination Date, up to three (3) times following the Closing Date, upon prior written notice by the Borrower Representative to the Administrative Agent, increase the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount (but not the Alternative Currency Sublimit, the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swingline Committed Amount) and/or establish one or more Incremental Term Facilities (each such increase and/or establishment of an Incremental Term Facility, an “Incremental Facility” and collectively, the “Incremental Facilities”), by a maximum aggregate amount not to exceed $200,000,000 for all such Incremental Facilities, as follows: (a) Increases in Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount. The U.S. Borrowers may, at any time and from time to time, upon prior written notice by the Borrower Representative to the Administrative Agent, increase the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount (but not the Alternative Currency Sublimit, the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swingline Committed Amount) with additional Revolving Commitments from any Revolving Bank or new Revolving
  57 CHAR1\1534998v8 Commitments from one or more other Persons selected by the Borrower Representative and acceptable to the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Bank and each Issuing Bank (so long as such Persons would be permitted at such time by Section 11.3(b)(v) to become assignees hereunder); provided that: (i) any such increase shall be in Dollars; (ii) any such increase shall be in a minimum principal amount of $25,000,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; (iii) no Default or Event of Default shall exist and be continuing at the time of any such increase; (iv) no existing Bank shall be under any obligation to increase its Revolving Commitment and any such decision whether to increase its Revolving Commitment shall be in such Bank’s sole and absolute discretion; (v) (A) any new Bank shall join this Credit Agreement by executing such joinder documents as are required by the Administrative Agent and/or (B) any existing Bank electing to increase its Revolving Commitment shall have executed a commitment agreement satisfactory to the Administrative Agent; (vi) as a condition precedent to such increase, the Borrower Representative shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent (A) a certificate of the Borrower Representative dated as of the date of such increase and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower Representative certifying that, before and after giving effect to such increase, (1) the representations and warranties made by the Credit Parties herein and in the other Credit Documents and which are contained in any certificate furnished at any time under or in connection herewith are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the date of such increase as if made on and as of such date (except (x) for those which expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case they shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of such earlier date, and (y) to the extent any such representation and warranty is qualified by materiality or reference to Material Adverse Effect, in which case, such representation and warranty shall be true and correct in all respects), and (2) no Default or Event of Default exists, and (B) a certificate of each Credit Party dated as of the date of such increase and signed by a Responsible Officer of each Credit Party certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by such Credit Party approving or consenting to such increase; (vii) a Financial Officer of the Parent shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent a Pro Forma Compliance Certificate demonstrating that, upon giving effect to any such increase on a Pro Forma Basis (and assuming for such calculation that such increase is fully drawn), the Credit Parties would be in compliance with the financial covenants set forth in Sections 7.10(a) and (b) as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter for which the Borrower Representative was required to deliver financial statements pursuant to Section 7.1(a) or Section 7.1(b); and (viii) Schedule 2.1 shall be deemed revised to include any increase in the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount pursuant to this Section 2.10(a) and to include thereon any Person that becomes a Bank pursuant to this Section 2.10(a).
  58 CHAR1\1534998v8 The Borrower Representative shall prepay any Revolving Loans owing by any Borrower and outstanding on the date of any such increase (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.12) to the extent necessary to keep the outstanding Revolving Loans ratable with any revised Revolving Commitments arising from any non-ratable increase in the Revolving Commitments under this Section. As of the effective date of any such increase, the Credit Agreement shall be amended to reflect the Incremental Facility and the joinder to the Credit Agreement of any Eligible Assignees providing such Incremental Facility. Such amendment shall be executed and delivered by the Administrative Agent, the Credit Parties and each Bank and Eligible Assignee providing such Incremental Facility without the consent of any other party. Such amendment shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. This Section shall supersede any provisions in Section 3.14 or 11.6 to the contrary. (b) Institution of Incremental Term Facilities. The U.S. Borrowers may, at any time and from time to time, upon prior written notice by the Borrower Representative to the Administrative Agent, institute an Incremental Term Facility from one or more Incremental Term Banks; provided that: (i) any such Incremental Term Facility shall be in Dollars and available only to a U.S. Borrower; (ii) any such Incremental Term Facility shall be in a minimum aggregate principal amount of $25,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; (iii) no Default or Event of Default shall exist and be continuing at the time of any such increase; (iv) no existing Bank shall be under any obligation to become an Incremental Term Bank and any such decision whether to become an Incremental Term Bank shall be in such Bank’s sole and absolute discretion; (v) the Borrower Representative (in consultation and coordination with the Administrative Agent) shall obtain commitments for the amount of such Incremental Term Facility from existing Banks or other Persons that are Eligible Assignees and that are acceptable to the Administrative Agent, which Persons shall join in this Credit Agreement as Incremental Term Banks by executing an Incremental Term Joinder Agreement; (vi) as a condition precedent to such Incremental Term Facility, the Borrower Representative shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent (A) a certificate of the Borrower Representative dated as of the date of such Incremental Term Facility and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower Representative certifying that, before and after giving effect to such Incremental Term Facility, (1) the representations and warranties made by the Credit Parties herein and in the other Credit Documents and which are contained in any certificate furnished at any time under or in connection herewith are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the date of the incurrence of such Incremental Term Facility as if made on and as of such date (except (x) for those which expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case they shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of such earlier date, and (y) to the extent any such representation and warranty is qualified by materiality or reference to Material Adverse Effect, in which case, such representation and warranty shall be true and correct in all respects), and (2) no Default or Event of Default exists, and (B) a certificate of each Credit Party dated as of the date of the incurrence of such Incremental Term Facility and signed by a Responsible

Such amendment shall be executed and delivered by the Administrative Agent, the Credit Parties and each Bank and Eligible Assignee providing such Incremental Term Facility without the consent of any other party. Such amendment shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. This Section shall supersede any provisions in Section 3.14 or 11.6 to the contrary. 2.11 Extension of Revolving Termination Date. (a) Requests for Extension. The Borrowers may, by notice from the Borrower Representative to the Administrative Agent (who shall promptly notify the Revolving Banks), not
  60 CHAR1\1534998v8 later than 120 days prior to the Revolving Termination Date then in effect hereunder (the “Extension Date”), request that each Revolving Bank extend such Revolving Bank’s Revolving Termination Date for an additional year from the Revolving Termination Date then in effect hereunder (the “Existing Revolving Termination Date”); provided that no more than two extensions under this Section 2.11 may be permitted. (b) Revolving Bank Elections to Extend. Each Revolving Bank, acting in its sole and individual discretion, shall, by notice to the Administrative Agent given not later than the date (the “Notice Date”) that is 15 Business Days from the date which such Revolving Bank received notice from the Administrative Agent of the Borrowers’ request for an extension of the Existing Revolving Termination Date, advise the Administrative Agent whether or not such Revolving Bank agrees to such extension. Each Revolving Bank that determines not to so extend its Revolving Termination Date (a “Non-Extending Bank”) shall notify the Administrative Agent of such fact promptly after such determination (but in any event no later than the Notice Date), and any Revolving Bank that does not so advise the Administrative Agent on or before the Notice Date shall be deemed to be a Non-Extending Bank. The election of any Revolving Bank to agree to such extension shall not obligate any other Revolving Bank to so agree. (c) Notification by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower Representative of each Revolving Bank’s determination under this Section 2.11 no later than the date 15 days prior to the applicable Extension Date (or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the next preceding Business Day).

The Borrower Representative shall have the right on or before the Extension Date (effective as of the Extension Date) to replace the Revolving Commitments of any Non-Extending Banks with, and at its option add as “Revolving Banks” under this Credit Agreement, one or more Eligible Assignees (each, an “Additional Commitment Bank”) as provided in Section 11.18, each of which Additional Commitment Banks shall have entered into an Assignment and Assumption pursuant to which such Additional Commitment Bank shall, effective as of the applicable Extension Date, undertake a Revolving Commitment (and, if any such Additional Commitment Bank is already a Revolving Bank, such newly undertaken Revolving Commitment shall be in addition to such Revolving Bank’s existing Revolving Commitment hereunder on such date). (e) Effect of Extension. Effective as of the Extension Date, the Revolving Termination Date of each of the Revolving Banks that have agreed to extend their Revolving Termination Date and of each Additional Commitment Bank shall be extended to the date falling one year after the Existing Revolving Termination Date (except that, if such date is not a Business Day, such Revolving Termination Date as so extended shall be the next preceding Business Day) and each Additional Commitment Bank shall thereupon become a “Revolving Bank” for all purposes of this Credit Agreement; provided that there shall be no change in the Revolving Termination Date of any Non-Extending Bank and on such Revolving Termination Date of any Non-Extending Bank, such Non-Extending Bank’s outstanding Revolving Loans shall be paid in full together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon and accrued and unpaid fees due it hereunder and such Non-Extending Bank’s obligations in respect of outstanding Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans shall terminate. (f) Conditions to Effectiveness of Extensions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the extension of the Revolving Termination Date pursuant to this Section shall not be effective with respect to any Revolving Bank unless:
  61 CHAR1\1534998v8 (i) no Default or Event of Default exists on the date of such extension and after giving effect thereto; (ii) the representations and warranties made by the Credit Parties herein and in the other Credit Documents and which are contained in any certificate furnished at any time under or in connection herewith are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Extension Date as if made on and as of such date (except (x) for those which expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case they shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of such earlier date, and (y) to the extent any such representation and warranty is qualified by materiality or reference to Material Adverse Effect, in which case, such representation and warranty shall be true and correct in all respects); and (iii) to the extent the Revolving Commitments of any Non-Extending Bank shall not be replaced with Revolving Commitments from one or more Additional Commitment Banks on the applicable Extension Date as provided for in Section 2.11(d), and thus there shall be no change in the applicable Revolving Termination Date for such Non-Extending Bank, it is understood and agreed that (x) the Borrowers shall repay Revolving Loans outstanding on the applicable Revolving Termination Date of any such Non-Extending Bank (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.12) to the extent necessary to repay, nonratably, the Revolving Loans of all Non-Extending Banks and the pro rata shares of the remaining Revolving Banks shall be revised effective as of such date, (y) on such applicable Revolving Termination Date, the Revolving Commitments (and, if applicable, any LOC Commitment) of the Non-Extending Banks will be permanently terminated and the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount on and after such date will be equal to the Revolving Commitments of the remaining Revolving Banks (and, if applicable, the LOC Committed Amount on and after such date will be equal to the LOC Commitments of the remaining Revolving Banks that are Issuing Banks) and (z) to the extent that the outstanding Revolving Obligations as of such date (after giving effect to the repayment in full of each such Non-Extending Bank) exceed the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount then in effect (after giving effect to the termination of the Revolving Commitments of all Non-Extending Banks), the Borrowers shall immediately prepay Revolving Loans and/or Cash Collateralize the LOC Obligations in an aggregate amount equal to such excess. (g) Conflicting Provisions. This Section shall supersede any provisions in Section 3.14 and Section 11.6 to the contrary. 2.12 Additional Borrowers. (a) Additional Foreign Borrowers. The Borrower Representative may request that any of its Foreign Subsidiaries (each, an “Applicant Foreign Borrower”) be designated a Foreign Borrower under the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount by delivery of a written request to the Administrative Agent therefor. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Revolving Banks of any such request. Designation of any Applicant Foreign Borrower as a Foreign Borrower under the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount is subject to (i) delivery of an executed Note by such Applicant Foreign Borrower as may be requested by any Revolving Bank in connection therewith, (ii) delivery of supporting resolutions, articles of incorporation and bylaws (or their equivalents), incumbency certificates, opinions of counsel and such other items as the Administrative Agent or the Revolving Banks, as applicable, may request (including all documentation and other information requested in order to comply with applicable law, including without limitation “know your customer” due diligence), (iii) delivery of an executed Foreign
  62 CHAR1\1534998v8 Borrower Joinder Agreement, (iv) consent from each Revolving Bank and (v) execution of an amendment to this Credit Agreement to incorporate country specific and other items reasonably necessary to include such Applicant Foreign Borrower, such amendment to be reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, the Revolving Banks and the Borrowers. Each Revolving Bank shall, by notice to the Administrative Agent given not later than the date that is fifteen (15) Business Days from the date which such Revolving Bank received notice from the Administrative Agent of the Borrower Representative’s request to designate an Applicant Foreign Borrower as a Foreign Borrower, advise the Administrative Agent whether or not such Revolving Bank consents to such designation pursuant to Section 2.12(a)(iv). Any Revolving Bank that determines not to consent to the designation of such Applicant Foreign Borrower as a Foreign Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such fact promptly after such determination and any Revolving Bank not responding within such fifteen (15)-Business Day period shall be deemed to have determined not to so consent. (b) Additional U.S. Borrowers. Following the Term Facility Funding Date, the Borrower Representative may, from time to time, request that Mediq USA Holdings and/or Byram be designated a U.S. Borrower by delivery of a written request to the Administrative Agent therefor. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Banks of any such request. Designation of Mediq USA Holdings and/or Byram as a U.S. Borrower shall be subject to (i) delivery of an executed Note (or joinder to any existing Note) by Mediq USA Holdings and/or Byram as may be requested by any Revolving Bank in connection therewith, (ii) delivery of supporting resolutions, articles of incorporation and bylaws (or their equivalents), incumbency certificates, opinions of counsel and such other items as the Administrative Agent or any Revolving Bank, as applicable, may request (including all documentation and other information requested in order to comply with applicable law, including without limitation “know your customer” due diligence), and (iii) delivery of such joinder documentation as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request. 2.13 Designated Banks. Each of the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank, the Swingline Bank and each Bank at its option may make any Extension of Credit or otherwise perform its obligations hereunder through any Applicable Lending Office (each, a “Designated Bank”); provided that (a) any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of any Borrower to repay any Extension of Credit in accordance with the terms of this Credit Agreement. Any Designated Bank shall be considered a Bank; provided that in the case of an Affiliate or branch of a Bank, all provisions applicable to a Bank shall apply to such Affiliate or branch of such Bank to the same extent as such Bank; provided, further, that for the purposes only of voting in connection with any Credit Document, any participation by any Designated Bank in any outstanding Extension of Credit shall be deemed a participation of such Bank. SECTION 3 OTHER PROVISIONS RELATING TO CREDIT FACILITY 3.1 Default Rate. (a) If any amount of principal of any Loan is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.
  63 CHAR1\1534998v8 (b) If any amount (other than principal of any Loan) payable under any Credit Document is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, then upon the request of the Required Banks, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. (c) Upon the request of the Required Banks, while any Event of Default exists, the Borrowers shall pay interest on the principal amount of all outstanding Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. (d) Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand. 3.2 Conversion. The Borrower Representative shall have the option, on any Business Day, to extend existing Eurocurrency Rate Loans into a subsequent Interest Period or to convert Revolving Loans, Term Loans or Incremental Term Loans of one type into Revolving Loans, Term Loans or Incremental Term Loans of another type; provided, however, that (i) except as provided in Section 3.7, Eurocurrency Rate Loans may be converted into Base Rate Loans only on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) Eurocurrency Rate Loans may be extended, and Base Rate Loans may be converted into Eurocurrency Rate Loans, only if no Default or Event of Default is in existence on the date of extension or conversion, (iii) Revolving Loans, Term Loans or Incremental Term Loans extended as, or converted into, Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be in such minimum amounts as provided in Section 2.2(b), and (iv) any request for extension of or conversion to a Eurocurrency Rate Loan which shall fail to specify an Interest Period shall be deemed to be a request for an Interest Period of one month. Each such extension or conversion shall be effected by the Borrower Representative by giving written notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed in writing) to the Administrative Agent in the form of Schedule 3.2 (a “Notice of Extension/Conversion”) prior to 10:00 a.m. on (x) the same Business Day of, in the case of Base Rate Loans, (y) on the third Business Day prior to, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars or (z) four Business Days (or five Business Days in the case of a Special Notice Currency) in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies prior to, the date of the proposed extension or conversion, specifying the date of the proposed extension or conversion, the Revolving Loans, Term Loans and/or Incremental Term Loans to be so extended or converted, the types of Revolving Loans, Term Loans and/or Incremental Term Loans into which such Revolving Loans, Term Loans and/or Incremental Term Loans are to be converted and, if appropriate, the currency and the applicable Interest Periods with respect thereto. Each request for extension or conversion to any Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall be deemed to be a reaffirmation by the Borrower Representative that no Default or Event of Default then exists. In the event the Borrower Representative fails to request extension of or conversion to any Eurocurrency Rate Loan in accordance with this Section, or any such conversion or extension is not permitted or required by this Section, then such Revolving Loans, Term Loans and/or Incremental Term Loans shall be automatically converted into Base Rate Loans at the end of their Interest Period; provided that in the case of a failure to timely request a continuation of Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, such Loans shall be continued as Eurocurrency Rate Loans in their original currency with an Interest Period of one month. The Administrative Agent shall give each Bank notice as promptly as practicable of any such proposed conversion affecting any Revolving Loans, Term Loans and/or Incremental Term Loans. No Loan may be converted into or continued as a Loan denominated in a different currency, but instead must be prepaid in the original currency of such Revolving Loan and reborrowed in the other currency. 3.3 Termination of Commitments.
  64 CHAR1\1534998v8 (a) The Borrower Representative may from time to time permanently reduce the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount in whole or in part (in minimum principal amounts of $10,000,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof) upon three (3) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent; provided that after giving effect to any voluntary reduction, the aggregate amount of Revolving Obligations shall not exceed the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount, as reduced. The Revolving Commitment of each Revolving Bank shall be reduced by such Bank’s Revolving Commitment Percentage of such reduction amount. All fees in respect of the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount accrued until the effective date of any reduction or termination of the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount shall be paid on the effective date of such reduction or termination. (b) The Borrower Representative may from time to time permanently reduce the unused Term Commitments in whole or in part (in minimum principal amounts of $10,000,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof) upon three (3) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent. The Term Commitment of each Term Bank shall be reduced by such Bank’s Term Commitment Percentage of such reduction amount. All fees in respect of the Term Facility accrued until the effective date of any reduction or termination of the Term Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such reduction or termination. (c) The aggregate Term Commitments shall be automatically and permanently reduced (i) by the amount of any Borrowing of Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.1(d), and (ii) to zero on the last day of the Commitment Period for the Term Facility. 3.4 Prepayments. (a) Voluntary Prepayments. The Borrowers shall have the right to prepay Loans in whole or in part from time to time without premium or penalty; provided that (i) Eurocurrency Rate Loans may only be prepaid (A) on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto or (B) on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto if the Borrowers pay to the applicable Banks any amounts due under Section 3.12, (ii) each such partial prepayment shall be in a minimum principal amount of $5,000,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or the amount then outstanding, if less), and (iii) the Borrower Representative will provide notice to the Administrative Agent of any voluntary prepayment by 10:00 a.m. on the date of prepayment. Amounts prepaid on the Loans may be reborrowed in accordance with the provisions hereof. Each voluntary prepayment of Term Loans and Incremental Term Loans shall be applied to the Term Loans and any Incremental Term Loans on a pro rata basis, and shall be applied to the principal repayment installments thereof on a pro rata basis. Unless otherwise specified by the Borrower Representative, prepayments on the Revolving Obligations shall be applied first to Daily LIBOR Swingline Loans, then to Base Rate Loans and then to Eurocurrency Rate Loans in direct order of Interest Periods. (b) Mandatory Prepayments. (i) Revolving Obligations. If at any time (A) the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Obligations shall exceed the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount, (B) the aggregate principal amount of Swingline Loans shall exceed the Swingline Committed Amount, (C) the aggregate principal amount of LOC Obligations shall exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit or (D) the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower Representative that the Outstanding Amount of all Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies at such time exceeds an amount equal to 105% of the Alternative Currency Sublimit then in effect, then in any such instance, the Borrowers shall immediately make payment on the Revolving
  65 CHAR1\1534998v8 Loans and/or to a cash collateral account in respect of LOC Obligations in an amount sufficient to eliminate the difference; provided that the Borrowers may, with respect to clauses (B) and (C) above, utilize a borrowing of Revolving Loans to the extent the conditions of Section 5.2 are satisfied for such payment or cash collateral if the incurrence of such Revolving Loans would not cause the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Obligations to exceed the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount. (ii) Asset Dispositions and Involuntary Dispositions. Promptly upon receipt by any Credit Party or any Subsidiary of the Net Cash Proceeds of any Asset Disposition (other than any Permitted Asset Swap or any Asset Disposition consummated in reliance on Section 8.5(a) or Section 8.5(b)) or any Involuntary Disposition, the Borrowers shall prepay the Term Loans and any then-existing Incremental Term Loans as hereinafter provided in an aggregate amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of such Net Cash Proceeds; provided that such Net Cash Proceeds shall not be required to be so applied if, at the election of the Borrower Representative (as notified by the Borrower Representative to the Administrative Agent), such Net Cash Proceeds are reinvested in assets (other than current assets) that are used or useful in the business of the members of the Consolidated Group within ninety (90) days after the date of receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds from such Asset Sale or Involuntary Disposition, or are contractually committed to be applied to purchase such assets within such ninety (90) day period and are so applied within one hundred eighty (180) days after the end of such ninety (90) day period; provided, further, if such Net Cash Proceeds shall have not been so reinvested by the end of such period, such Net Cash Proceeds shall be immediately applied to prepay the Term Loans and any then- existing Incremental Term Loans. Any prepayment pursuant to this clause (ii) shall be applied as set forth in clause (iv) below. (iii) Debt Issuance. Promptly upon the receipt by any Credit Party or any Subsidiary of the Net Cash Proceeds of any Debt Issuance, the Borrowers shall prepay the Term Loans and any then-existing Incremental Term Loans as hereinafter provided in an aggregate amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of such Net Cash Proceeds. Any prepayment pursuant to this clause (iii) shall be applied as set forth in clause (iv) below. (iv) Application. Each prepayment pursuant to the foregoing provisions of Sections 3.4(b)(ii) and (iii) shall be applied to the Term Loans and any then-existing Incremental Term Loans on a pro rata basis and to the principal repayment installments thereof on a pro rata basis. Such prepayments shall be paid to the Banks in accordance with their respective Term Commitment Percentages and/or Incremental Term Commitment Percentages. 3.5 Fees. (a) Unused Fee. In consideration of the Revolving Commitments, the Borrowers agree to pay to the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Revolving Banks a fee (the “Unused Fee”), in Dollars, for the period from the Closing Date to the Revolving Termination Date equal to the Applicable Percentage per annum on the Dollar Equivalent of the actual daily unused amount of the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount for the applicable period. The Unused Fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December for the immediately preceding quarter (or a portion thereof) beginning with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date and on the Revolving Termination Date. For purposes of computation of the Unused Fee, (i) LOC Obligations shall be counted toward and considered usage
  66 CHAR1\1534998v8 of the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount and (ii) Swingline Loans shall not be counted toward nor considered usage of the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount. (b) Administrative Agent’s Fee. The Borrowers agree to pay, in Dollars, to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, the administrative and other fees referred to in the Wells Fargo Fee Letter. (c) Term Facility Unused Fee. In consideration of the Term Commitments, the Borrowers agree to pay to the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Term Banks a fee (the “Term Facility Unused Fee”), in Dollars, for the period from the Closing Date to the last day of the Commitment Period for the Term Facility equal to the Applicable Percentage per annum on the actual daily unused amount of the Term Facility for the applicable period. The Term Facility Unused Fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December for the immediately preceding quarter (or a portion thereof) beginning with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date and on the last day of the Commitment Period for the Term Facility. 3.6 Capital Adequacy. If any Bank or any Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law affecting such Bank or such Issuing Bank or any Applicable Lending Office of such Bank or such Bank’s or such Issuing Bank’s parent company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Bank’s or such Issuing Bank’s (including, for purposes hereof, the parent company of such Bank or such Issuing Bank) capital or assets as a consequence of this Credit Agreement, the Commitments of such Bank or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans held by, such Bank, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Bank or such Issuing Bank or such Bank’s or such Issuing Bank’s parent company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Bank’s or such Issuing Bank’s policies with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity and such Bank’s or such Issuing Bank’s parent company’s policies with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity), then from time to time the U.S. Borrowers will pay to such Bank or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank or such Issuing Bank or such Bank’s or such Issuing Bank’s parent company for any such reduction suffered. A certificate of a Bank or an Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Bank or such Issuing Bank or its parent company, as the case may be, as specified above and delivered to the Borrower Representative shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The U.S. Borrowers shall pay such Bank or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof. Failure or delay on the part of any Bank or any Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.6 shall not constitute a waiver of such Bank’s or such Issuing Bank’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the U.S. Borrowers shall not be required to compensate a Bank or an Issuing Bank pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the date that such Bank or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower Representative of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Bank’s or such Issuing Bank’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the one hundred twenty (120) day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 3.7 Limitation on Eurocurrency Rate Loans.
  67 CHAR1\1534998v8 (a) If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any Eurocurrency Rate Loan (whether in Dollars or an Alternative Currency), (i) the Administrative Agent determines that (A) deposits (whether in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for such currency for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, or (B) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan (in each case with respect to clause (i), “Impacted Loans”), or (ii) the Administrative Agent or the Required Banks determine that for any reason Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower Representative and each Bank. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Banks to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurocurrency Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Banks) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, any Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in Dollars in the amount specified therein. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in clause (a)(i) above, the Administrative Agent in consultation with the Borrower Representative and the Required Banks, may establish an alternative interest rate for the Impacted Loans, in which case, such alternative rate of interest shall apply with respect to the Impacted Loans until (i) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the Impacted Loans under clause (a)(i) above, (ii) the Administrative Agent or the Required Banks notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower Representative that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Banks of funding the Impacted Loans, or (iii) any Bank determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Bank or its Applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Bank to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower Representative written notice thereof. 3.8 Illegality. If any Bank determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Bank or its Applicable Lending Office to perform any of its obligations hereunder or to make, maintain or fund or charge interest with respect to any Extension of Credit or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate or the Daily LIBOR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Bank to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or any Alternative Currency in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Bank to the Borrower Representative through the Administrative Agent, (a) any obligation of such Bank to issue, make, maintain, fund or charge interest with respect to any such Extension of Credit or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Daily LIBOR Swingline Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in Dollars, to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be suspended, and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Bank
  68 CHAR1\1534998v8 making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Bank shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Bank notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower Representative that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (i) each Borrower shall, upon demand from such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable and such Loans are denominated in Dollars, convert all Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Daily LIBOR Swingline Loans of such Bank to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Bank shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Bank may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Daily LIBOR Swingline Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Bank may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Daily LIBOR Swingline Loans, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Bank determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Bank without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Bank that it is no longer illegal for such Bank to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the U.S. Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. 3.9 Requirements of Law. (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall: (i) impose, modify, or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, assessment, or similar requirement (other than Taxes) against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Bank or any Issuing Bank; (ii) subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or (iii) impose on any Bank or any Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Credit Agreement or Loans made by such Bank or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank, such Issuing Bank or such other Recipient of making, converting into, continuing, or maintaining any Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Bank, such Issuing Bank or such other Recipient of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank, Issuing Bank or other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Bank, Issuing Bank or other Recipient, the U.S. Borrowers will pay to such Bank, Issuing Bank or other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank, Issuing Bank or other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. (b) Mandatory Costs. If any Bank or any Issuing Bank incurs any Mandatory Costs attributable to the Obligations, then from time to time the U.S. Borrowers will pay to such Bank or
  69 CHAR1\1534998v8 such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such Mandatory Costs. Such amount shall be expressed as a percentage rate per annum and shall be payable on the full amount of the applicable Obligations. (c) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Bank or an Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Bank or such Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in clause (a) or (b) above and delivered to the Borrower Representative shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The U.S. Borrowers shall pay such Bank or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof. (d) Reserves on Eurocurrency Rate Loans. The U.S. Borrowers shall pay to each Bank, (i) as long as such Bank shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as “Eurocurrency liabilities”), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurocurrency Rate Loan or Daily LIBOR Swingline Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Bank (as determined by such Bank in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), and (ii) as long as such Bank shall be required to comply with any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the maintenance of the Commitments or the funding of the Loans, such additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Commitment or Loan by such Bank (as determined by such Bank in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which in each case shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan, provided the Borrower Representative shall have received at least ten (10) days’ prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest or costs from such Bank. If a Bank fails to give notice ten (10) days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable ten (10) days from receipt of such notice. (e) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Bank or any Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.9 shall not constitute a waiver of such Bank’s or such Issuing Bank’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the U.S. Borrowers shall not be required to compensate a Bank or an Issuing Bank pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the date that such Bank or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower Representative of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Bank’s or such Issuing Bank’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the one hundred twenty (120) day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 3.10 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Banks. (a) Designation of a Different Applicable Lending Office. If any Bank requests compensation under Section 3.6 or Section 3.9, or requires the Borrowers to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Bank, any Issuing Bank, or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Bank or any Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 3.11, or if any Bank gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.8, then at the request of the Borrower Representative, such Bank or such Issuing Bank shall, as applicable, use reasonable efforts to designate a different Applicable Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Bank or such Issuing Bank, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to
  70 CHAR1\1534998v8 Section 3.6, Section 3.9 or Section 3.11, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.8, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Bank or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Bank or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be. The U.S. Borrowers hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Bank or any Issuing Bank in connection with any such designation or assignment. (b) Replacement of Banks. If any Bank requests compensation under Section 3.6 or Section 3.9, or if the Borrowers are required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Bank or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Bank pursuant to Section 3.11 and, in each case, such Bank has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 3.10(a), the Borrower Representative may replace such Bank in accordance with Section 11.18. (c) Survival. All of the Borrowers’ obligations under Sections 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.11 and 3.12 shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments, repayment in full in cash of all other Obligations hereunder, and resignation of the Administrative Agent. 3.11 Taxes. (a) Payments Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Payments on Account of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Credit Parties hereunder or under any other Credit Document shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Laws. If any applicable Law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Taxes, including both United States Federal backup withholding and withholding Taxes, from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Credit Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including deductions or withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.11) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made. (b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Credit Parties. The Credit Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Laws any Other Taxes. (c) Tax Indemnification. (i) Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) above or duplicating the payments to be made thereunder, the Credit Parties shall indemnify each Recipient for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this subsection (c)) withheld or deducted from a payment to, or paid by, such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. Payments under the preceding sentence shall be made within ten (10) days after the date the party entitled to indemnification makes a demand therefor. The Credit Parties shall also, and do hereby, indemnify the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within ten days after demand therefor, for any amount which a Bank or an
  71 CHAR1\1534998v8 Issuing Bank for any reason fails to pay indefeasibly to the Administrative Agent as required by clause (ii) of this subsection. A certificate as to the amount of any such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower Representative by a Bank or an Issuing Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Bank or an Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (ii) Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) above, each Bank and each Issuing Bank shall indemnify the Administrative Agent for (A) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Bank or such Issuing Bank (but only to the extent that any Credit Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Credit Parties to do so), (B) any Taxes attributable to such Bank’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 11.3(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (C) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Bank or such Issuing Bank, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Credit Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. Payments under the preceding sentence shall be made within ten (10) days after the date the party entitled to indemnification makes a demand therefor (which demand shall include a written statement setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for and such party’s calculation of the claim). Each Bank and each Issuing Bank hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Bank or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, under this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this clause (ii). The agreements in this clause (ii) shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Bank or an Issuing Bank, the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations. (d) Evidence of Payments. Upon request by any Credit Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, after any payment of Taxes by such Credit Party or by the Administrative Agent to a Governmental Authority as provided in this Section 3.11, such Credit Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent shall deliver to such Credit Party, as the case may be, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return required by Law to report such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to such Credit Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be. (e) Status of Banks; Tax Documentation. (i) Each Bank that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Credit Document shall deliver to the Borrower Representative and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower Representative or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower Representative or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Bank, if reasonably requested by the Borrower Representative or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower Representative or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower Representative or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Bank is
  72 CHAR1\1534998v8 subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 3.11(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Bank’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Bank to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Bank. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) any Bank that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower Representative and the Administrative Agent, on or prior to the date on which such Bank becomes a Bank under this Credit Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower Representative or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 certifying that such Bank is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; and (B) each Foreign Bank shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower Representative and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Bank becomes a Bank under this Credit Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower Representative or the Administrative Agent, whichever of the following is applicable: (I) in the case of a Foreign Bank claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Credit Document, executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Credit Document, Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty, (II) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W- 8ECI, (III) in the case of a Foreign Bank claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Schedule 3.11- 1 to the effect that such Foreign Bank is not (A) a “bank” within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, (B) a “10 percent shareholder” of any Borrower within the meaning of section 871(h)(3)(B) or section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code, or (C) a “controlled foreign corporation” described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W- 8BEN-E, or
  73 CHAR1\1534998v8 (IV) to the extent a Foreign Bank is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY, accompanied by Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Schedule 3.11-2 or Schedule 3.11-3, Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 and/or other supporting documentation from each beneficial owner, as applicable (including, without limitation, if the Foreign Bank is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, required supporting documentation with respect to such Foreign Bank’s direct and indirect partners that are claiming the portfolio interest exemption); provided that if the Foreign Bank is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Bank are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Bank may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Schedule 3.11-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner, (C) each Foreign Bank shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower Representative and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Bank becomes a Bank under this Credit Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower Representative or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable Laws as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding Tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Laws or otherwise reasonably requested by the Borrower Representative or the Administrative Agent to permit the Borrower Representative or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made, and (D) if a payment made to a Bank under any Credit Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Bank were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as applicable), such Bank shall deliver to the Borrower Representative and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower Representative or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower Representative or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Bank has complied with such Bank’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the Closing Date. (iii) Each Bank agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower Representative and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
  74 CHAR1\1534998v8 Additionally, each of the Borrowers shall promptly deliver to the Administrative Agent or any Bank, as the Administrative Agent or such Bank shall reasonably request, on or prior to the Closing Date, and in a timely fashion thereafter, such documents and forms required by any relevant taxing authorities under the Laws of any jurisdiction, duly executed and completed by such Borrower, as are required to be furnished by such Bank or the Administrative Agent under such Laws in connection with any payment by the Administrative Agent or any Bank of Taxes, or otherwise in connection with the Credit Documents, with respect to such jurisdiction. (f) Treatment of Certain Refunds. Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Bank or any Issuing Bank, or have any obligation to pay to any Bank or any Issuing Bank, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Bank or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be. If the Administrative Agent, any Bank or any Issuing Bank determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes (whether received in cash or as an overpayment applied by the Administrative Agent, such Bank or such Issuing Bank to offset an amount of Tax otherwise due and payable) as to which it has been indemnified by any Credit Party or with respect to which any Credit Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.11, it shall pay to such Credit Party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Credit Party under this Section 3.11 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by the Administrative Agent, such Bank or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided that each Credit Party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Bank or such Issuing Bank, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Credit Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Bank or such Issuing Bank in the event the Administrative Agent, such Bank or such Issuing Bank is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (f), in no event will a Recipient be required to pay any amount to a Credit Party pursuant to this paragraph (f) the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Bank or any Issuing Bank to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower Representative or any other Person. (g) Survival. Each party’s obligations under this Section 3.11 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Bank, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Credit Document. (h) Definitions. For purposes of this Section 3.11, the term “applicable Laws” includes FATCA and the term “Bank” shall include each Issuing Bank. 3.12 Compensation. Upon demand of any Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrowers shall promptly compensate such Bank for and hold such Bank harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:
  75 CHAR1\1534998v8 (a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan or Daily LIBOR Swingline Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); or (b) any failure by the Borrowers (for a reason other than the failure of such Bank to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan or Daily LIBOR Swingline Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower Representative; or (c) any failure by any Borrower to make payment of any Loan or drawing under any Letter of Credit (or interest due thereon) denominated in an Alternative Currency on its scheduled due date or any payment thereof in a different currency; or (d) the assignment of any Eurocurrency Rate Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrowers pursuant to Section 11.18; including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the performance of any foreign exchange contract (but excluding any loss of anticipated profits). The Borrowers shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Bank in connection with the foregoing. For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrowers to the Banks under this Section 3.12, each Bank shall be deemed to have funded each Eurocurrency Rate Loan made by it at the Eurocurrency Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the applicable offshore Dollar interbank market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurocurrency Rate Loan was in fact so funded. 3.13 Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (a) Loans and Letters of Credit. Each Revolving Loan, Term Loan or Incremental Term Loan advance, each payment or prepayment of principal of any Revolving Loan, any Term Loan or any Incremental Term Loan or reimbursement obligations arising from drawings under Letters of Credit, each payment of interest on the Revolving Loans, the Term Loans and the Incremental Term Loans or reimbursement obligations arising from drawings under Letters of Credit, each payment of Unused Fees or Term Facility Unused Fees, each payment of the Standby Letter of Credit Fee, each reduction of the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount, each reduction of the Term Commitments, and each conversion or extension of any Revolving Loan, any Term Loan or any Incremental Term Loan, shall be allocated pro rata among the Banks in accordance with the respective Revolving Commitment Percentages, Term Commitment Percentages and/or Incremental Term Commitment Percentages, as applicable. (b) Advances. (i) No Bank shall be responsible for the failure or delay by any other Bank in its obligation to make its ratable share of a borrowing hereunder, except for adjustments provided in Section 3.18(a)(iv) to the Revolving Commitment Percentage of each Bank that is not a Defaulting Bank; provided, however, that the failure of any Bank to fulfill its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligations hereunder.
  76 CHAR1\1534998v8 (ii) Unless any Borrower or any Bank has notified the Administrative Agent prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that such Borrower or such Bank, as the case may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower or such Bank, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds, then: (A) if the Borrowers failed to make such payment, each Bank shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Bank in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Bank to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds, at the Overnight Rate from time to time in effect; and (B) if any Bank failed to make such payment, such Bank shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent the amount thereof in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon for the period from the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrowers to the date such amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent (the “Compensation Period”) at a rate per annum equal to the Overnight Rate from time to time in effect. If such Bank does not pay such amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent’s demand therefor, the Administrative Agent may make a demand therefor upon the Borrower Representative, and the Borrowers shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Bank from its obligation to fulfill its Commitments or to prejudice any rights that the Administrative Agent or the Borrowers may have against any Bank as a result of any default by such Bank hereunder. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Bank with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 3.14 Sharing of Payments. The Banks agree among themselves that, in the event that any Bank shall obtain payment in respect of any Loan, LOC Obligations or any other obligation owing to such Bank under this Credit Agreement through the exercise of a right of setoff, banker’s lien or counterclaim, or pursuant to a secured claim under Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States Code or other security or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such Bank under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or otherwise, or by any other means, in excess of its pro rata share of such payment as provided for in this Credit Agreement, such Bank shall promptly purchase from the other Banks a participation interest in such Loans, LOC Obligations and other obligations in such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to time, as shall be equitable to the end that all Banks share such payment in accordance with their respective ratable shares as provided for in this Credit Agreement. The Banks further agree among themselves that if payment to a Bank obtained by such Bank through the exercise of a right of setoff, banker’s lien, counterclaim or other event as aforesaid shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored, each Bank which shall have shared the benefit of such payment shall, by repurchase of a participation
  77 CHAR1\1534998v8 interest theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit (together with its share of any accrued interest payable with respect thereto) to each Bank whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored. The Borrowers agree that any Bank so purchasing such a participation interest may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all rights of payment, including setoff, banker’s lien or counterclaim, with respect to such participation interest as fully as if such Bank were a holder of such Loans, LOC Obligations or other obligation in the amount of such participation interest. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Credit Agreement, if any Bank or the Administrative Agent shall fail to remit to the Administrative Agent or any other Bank an amount payable by such Bank or the Administrative Agent to the Administrative Agent or such other Bank pursuant to this Credit Agreement on the date when such amount is due, such payments shall be made together with interest thereon for each date from the date such amount is due until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent or such other Bank at a rate per annum equal to the Overnight Rate. If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Bank receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this Section 3.14 applies, such Bank shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Banks under this Section 3.14 to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim. 3.15 Payments, Computations, Retroactive Adjustments of Applicable Percentage, Etc. (a) Generally. All payments hereunder and under any other Credit Document shall be made by the Borrowers without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff of any kind. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein and except with respect to principal and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, all payments made by a Credit Party hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Banks to which such payment is owed, in Dollars in Same Day Funds, at the Administrative Agent’s office specified in Section 11.1. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder with respect to principal and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Banks to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent’s Office in such Alternative Currency and in Same Day Funds not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent on the dates specified herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this Credit Agreement be made in the United States. If, for any reason, any Borrower is prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency, such Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative Currency payment amount. All payments shall be received by the Administrative Agent not later than (i) 2:00 p.m. on the date when due in the case of payments in Dollars and (ii) the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent on the date when due in the case of payments in Alternative Currencies. Payments received after such time shall be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day. The Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) debit the amount of any such payment which is not made by such time to any ordinary deposit account of the Borrowers or any other Credit Party maintained with the Administrative Agent (with notice to the Borrower Representative or such other Credit Party). The Borrowers shall, at the time it makes any payment under this Credit Agreement, specify to the Administrative Agent the Loans, LOC Obligations, fees, interest or other amounts payable by the Borrowers hereunder to which such payment is to be applied (and in the event that it fails so to specify, or if such application would be inconsistent with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Banks in such manner as the Administrative Agent may determine to be appropriate in respect of obligations owing by the Borrowers hereunder, subject to the terms of Section 3.13(a)). The Administrative Agent will distribute such payments to such Banks, if any such payment is received prior to 2:00 p.m. on a Business Day in like funds as received prior to the end of such Business Day and otherwise the Administrative Agent will distribute such payment to such Banks on the next
  78 CHAR1\1534998v8 succeeding Business Day. Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day (subject to accrual of interest and fees for the period of such extension), except that in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, if the extension would cause the payment to be made in the next following calendar month, then such payment shall instead be made on the next preceding Business Day. Except as expressly provided otherwise herein, all computations of interest for Base Rate Loans (including Base Rate Loans determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate) shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365 day year), or, in the case of interest in respect of Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies as to which market practice differs from the foregoing, in accordance with such market practice. (b) Allocation of Payments After Event of Default. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Credit Agreement to the contrary, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and upon the exercise of remedies in accordance with Section 9.2, all amounts collected or received on or in respect of the Obligations (or other amounts owing under the Credit Documents or other documentation in respect of the Obligations in connection therewith) shall be paid over or delivered as follows: FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees) of the Administrative Agent in connection with enforcing the rights and remedies of the Banks under the Credit Documents made with respect thereto; SECOND, to payment of any fees owed to the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such under the Credit Documents; THIRD, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees) of each of the Banks hereunder in connection with enforcing its rights under the Credit Documents or otherwise with respect to the Obligations owing to such Bank; FOURTH, to the payment of all accrued interest and fees on or in respect of the Obligations; FIFTH, to the payment of the outstanding principal amount of the Obligations hereunder (including the payment or cash collateralization of the outstanding LOC Obligations), all Obligations under any Swap Contract between any Credit Party or any Subsidiary and any Bank or Affiliate of a Bank that is permitted to be incurred pursuant to Section 8.1(g), and all Obligations under any Treasury Management Agreement between any Credit Party or any Subsidiary and any Bank or Affiliate of a Bank, in each case ratably among the respective parties in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause “FIFTH” held by them; SIXTH, to all other Obligations hereunder and other obligations which shall have become due and payable under the Credit Documents otherwise and not repaid pursuant to clauses “FIRST” through “FIFTH” above; and SEVENTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to the Borrower Representative.
  79 CHAR1\1534998v8 In carrying out the foregoing, (i) amounts received shall be applied in the numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to the next succeeding category; and (ii) except as otherwise provided, the Banks (and Affiliates thereof) shall receive amounts ratably in accordance with their respective pro rata share (based on the proportion that the then outstanding Obligations held by such Banks (and Affiliates thereof) bears to the aggregate amount of the Obligations then outstanding) of amounts available to be applied pursuant to clauses “THIRD”, “FOURTH”, “FIFTH” and “SIXTH” above; and (iii) to the extent that any amounts available for distribution pursuant to clause “FIFTH” above are attributable to the issued but undrawn amount of outstanding Letters of Credit, such amounts shall be held by the Administrative Agent in a cash collateral account and applied (A) first, to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for any drawings under such Letters of Credit and (B) then, following the expiration of all Letters of Credit, to all other obligations of the types described in clauses “FOURTH”, “FIFTH” and “SIXTH” above in the manner provided in this Section 3.15(b). Excluded Swap Obligations with respect to any Credit Party shall not be paid with amounts received from such Credit Party or its assets, but appropriate adjustments shall be made with respect to payments from other Credit Parties to preserve the allocation to Obligations otherwise set forth above in this Section. (c) Retroactive Adjustments of Applicable Percentage. If, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of the Parent or for any other reason, the Borrower Representative or the Banks determine that (i) the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio as calculated by the Parent as of any applicable date was inaccurate at the time so calculated and (ii) a proper calculation of the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio would have resulted in higher pricing for such period, the Borrowers shall immediately and retroactively be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Banks or the applicable Issuing Banks, as the case may be, promptly on demand by the Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to any Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code, automatically and without further action by the Administrative Agent, any Bank or any Issuing Bank), an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period. This paragraph shall not limit the rights of the Administrative Agent, any Bank or any Issuing Bank, as the case may be, under Section 2.6(a)(iii), 2.6(f) or 3.1 or under Section 9. The Borrowers’ obligations under this paragraph shall survive the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment of all other Obligations hereunder. 3.16 Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Bank shall maintain an account or accounts evidencing each Loan made by such Bank to the Borrowers from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Bank from time to time under this Credit Agreement. Each Bank will make reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy of its account or accounts and to promptly update its account or accounts from time to time, as necessary. (b) The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to Section 11.3(c), and a subaccount for each Bank, in which Register and subaccounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the amount, type and Interest Period of each such Loan hereunder, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable to each Bank hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from or for the account of any Credit Party and each Bank’s share thereof. The Administrative Agent will make reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy of the subaccounts referred to in the preceding sentence and to promptly update such subaccounts from time to time, as necessary.
  80 CHAR1\1534998v8 (c) The entries made in the accounts, Register and subaccounts maintained pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 3.16 (and, if consistent with the entries of the Administrative Agent, subsection (a)) shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of the Credit Parties therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure of any Bank or the Administrative Agent to maintain any such account, such Register or such subaccount, as applicable, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Credit Parties to repay the Obligations and other amounts owing to such Bank. 3.17 Certain Limitations. If any Bank requests compensation or indemnification from the Borrowers under Section 3.6, 3.9 or 3.11, then such Bank will agree to use reasonable efforts to change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office so as to eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue if such change, in the reasonable judgment of such Bank, is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. 3.18 Defaulting Banks. (a) Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Credit Agreement, if any Bank becomes a Defaulting Bank, then, until such time as that Bank is no longer a Defaulting Bank, to the extent permitted by applicable Law: (i) Waivers and Amendments. That Defaulting Bank’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Credit Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in Section 11.6. (ii) Reallocation of Payments. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of that Defaulting Bank (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Section 9 or otherwise, and including any amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by that Defaulting Bank pursuant to Section 11.2), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Bank to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Bank to any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Bank hereunder; third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent or requested by any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Bank, to be held as Cash Collateral for future funding obligations of that Defaulting Bank of any participation in any Swingline Loan or Letter of Credit; fourth, as the Borrower Representative may request (so long as no Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which that Defaulting Bank has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Credit Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower Representative, to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of that Defaulting Bank to fund Loans under this Credit Agreement; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Banks, the Issuing Banks or the Swingline Bank as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Bank, any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Bank against that Defaulting Bank as a result of that Defaulting Bank’s breach of its obligations under this Credit Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrowers as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrowers against that Defaulting Bank as a result of that Defaulting Bank’s breach of its obligations under this Credit Agreement; and eighth, to that Defaulting Bank or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment
  81 CHAR1\1534998v8 is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or LOC Borrowings in respect of which that Defaulting Bank has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y) such Loans or LOC Borrowings were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and LOC Borrowings owed to, all non-Defaulting Banks on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or LOC Borrowings owed to, that Defaulting Bank. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Bank that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Bank or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 3.18(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Bank, and each Bank irrevocably consents hereto. (iii) Certain Fees. That Defaulting Bank (x) shall not be entitled to receive any unused fee pursuant to Section 3.5(a) or Section 3.5(c) for any period during which that Bank is a Defaulting Bank (and the Borrowers shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Bank) and (y) shall be limited in its right to receive Standby Letter of Credit Fees as provided in Section 2.6(f). (iv) Reallocation of Applicable Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure. During any period in which there is a Defaulting Bank, for purposes of computing the amount of the obligation of each non-Defaulting Bank to acquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans pursuant to Sections 2.1, 2.4, 2.6 or 2.7, the “Revolving Commitment Percentage” of each non-Defaulting Bank shall be computed without giving effect to the Revolving Commitment of that Defaulting Bank; provided that (i) each such reallocation shall be given effect only if, at the date the applicable Bank becomes a Defaulting Bank, no Default exists; and (ii) the aggregate obligation of each non-Defaulting Bank to acquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans shall not exceed the positive difference, if any, of (1) the Revolving Commitment of that non-Defaulting Bank minus (2) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Loans of that Bank. Subject to Section 11.22, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Bank arising from that Bank having become a Defaulting Bank, including any claim of a non-Defaulting Bank as a result of such non-Defaulting Bank’s increased exposure following such reallocation. (b) Defaulting Bank Cure. If the Borrower Representative, the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Bank and each Issuing Bank agree in writing in their sole discretion that a Defaulting Bank should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Bank, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Bank will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Banks or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Banks in accordance with their Revolving Commitment Percentages (without giving effect to Section 3.18(a)(iv)), whereupon that Bank will cease to be a Defaulting Bank; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrowers while that Bank was a Defaulting Bank; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties and subject to Section 11.22, no change hereunder from Defaulting Bank to Bank will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Bank’s having been a Defaulting Bank.
  82 CHAR1\1534998v8 3.19 Cash Collateral. (a) Certain Credit Support Events. (i) Upon the request of the Administrative Agent or an Issuing Bank (A) if such Issuing Bank has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an LOC Borrowing, or (B) if, as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any LOC Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, the Borrowers shall, in each case, immediately Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all LOC Obligations. (ii) At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Bank, immediately upon the request of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Bank, the Borrowers shall deliver to the Administrative Agent Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to cover all Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 3.18(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Bank).

(iv) The Administrative Agent may, at any time and from time to time after the initial deposit of Cash Collateral, request that additional Cash Collateral be provided in order to protect against the results of exchange rate fluctuations. (b) Grant of Security Interest.

If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the applicable Fronting Exposure and other obligations secured thereby, the Borrowers will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency. (c) Application. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Credit Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under any of this Section 3.19 or Sections 2.1, 2.4, 2.6, 2.7, 3.18 or 9.2 in respect of Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans shall be held and applied to the satisfaction of the specific LOC Obligations, Swingline Loans, obligations to fund participations therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Bank, any interest accrued on such obligation) and other obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may be provided for herein.
  83 CHAR1\1534998v8 (d) Release. Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce Fronting Exposure or other obligations shall be released promptly following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of Defaulting Bank status of the applicable Bank (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with Section 11.3(b)(vi))) or (ii) the Administrative Agent’s good faith determination that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided, however, (x) that Cash Collateral furnished by or on behalf of a Credit Party shall not be released during the continuance of a Default or Event of Default (and following application as provided in this Section 3.19 may be otherwise applied in accordance with Section 9.2), and (y) the Person providing Cash Collateral and the applicable Issuing Bank or the Swingline Bank, as applicable, may agree that Cash Collateral shall not be released but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations. 3.20 ERISA.

SECTION 4 GUARANTY 4.1 The Guaranty. Each of the Guarantors hereby jointly and severally guarantees to each Bank, each Issuing Bank, each affiliate of a Bank that has entered into a Swap Contract or a Treasury Management Agreement with any Credit Party or any Subsidiary, the Administrative Agent and each other holder of the Obligations, as hereinafter provided, as primary obligor and not as surety, the prompt payment of the Obligations in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise) strictly in accordance with the terms thereof. The Guarantors hereby further agree that if any of the Obligations are not paid in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise), the Guarantors will, jointly and severally, promptly pay the same, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in any other of the Credit Documents, Swap Contracts or Treasury Management Agreements, the obligations of each Guarantor (other than the Parent) under this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render such obligations subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provisions of any applicable state law. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in any other of the Credit Documents or Swap Contracts, Obligations of a Loan Party shall exclude any Excluded Swap Obligations with respect to such Loan Party.
  84 CHAR1\1534998v8 4.2 Obligations Unconditional. The obligations of the Guarantors under Section 4.1 are joint and several, absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of any of the Credit Documents, Swap Contracts or Treasury Management Agreements, or any other agreement or instrument referred to therein, or any substitution, release, impairment or exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any of the Obligations, and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor, it being the intent of this Section 4.2 that the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances. Each Guarantor agrees that such Guarantor shall have no right of subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or contribution against the Borrowers or any other Guarantor for amounts paid under this Section 4 until such time as the Banks (or any affiliates of Banks entering into Swap Contracts or Treasury Management Agreements) have been paid in full in respect of all Obligations, the Aggregate Commitments have been terminated and no Person or Governmental Authority shall have any right to request any return or reimbursement of funds from the Banks (or any affiliates of the Banks that have entered into Swap Contracts or Treasury Management Agreements) in connection with monies received under the Credit Documents, Swap Contracts or Treasury Management Agreements between any member of the Consolidated Group and any Bank (or any affiliates of the Banks that have entered into Swap Contracts or Treasury Management Agreements). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the occurrence of any one or more of the following shall not alter or impair the liability of any Guarantor hereunder which shall remain absolute and unconditional as described above: (a) at any time or from time to time, without notice to any Guarantor, the time for any performance of or compliance with any of the Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or compliance shall be waived; (b) any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of any of the Credit Documents, Swap Contracts or Treasury Management Agreements between any member of the Consolidated Group and any Bank (or any affiliates of the Banks that have entered into Swap Contracts or Treasury Management Agreements), or any other agreement or instrument referred to in the Credit Documents, Swap Contracts or Treasury Management Agreements shall be done or omitted; (c) the maturity of any of the Obligations shall be accelerated, or any of the Obligations shall be modified, supplemented or amended in any respect, or any right under any of the Credit Documents, any Swap Contracts or Treasury Management Agreements between any member of the Consolidated Group and any Bank (or any affiliates of the Banks that have entered into Swap Contracts or Treasury Management Agreements), any other agreement or instrument referred to in the Credit Documents or such Swap Contracts or Treasury Management Agreements shall be waived or any other guarantee of any of the Obligations or any security therefor shall be released, impaired or exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with; (d) any of the Obligations shall be determined to be void or voidable (including, without limitation, for the benefit of any creditor of any Guarantor) or shall be subordinated to the claims of any Person (including, without limitation, any creditor of any Guarantor); (e) any change in the corporate existence or structure of any Borrower; (f) any claims or set-off rights that the Guarantor may have against any Borrower or any Bank (or any affiliates of the Banks that have entered into Swap Contracts or Treasury Management Agreements); and
  85 CHAR1\1534998v8 (g) any law or regulation of any jurisdiction or any event affecting any term of a guaranteed obligation. With respect to its obligations hereunder, each Guarantor hereby expressly waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and all notices whatsoever, and any requirement that the Administrative Agent or any other holder of the Obligations exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against any Person under any of the Credit Documents or any other document relating to the Obligations, or against any other Person under any other guarantee of, or security for, any of the Obligations. 4.3 Reinstatement. The obligations of the Guarantors under this Section 4 shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of any Person in respect of the Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise, and each Guarantor agrees that it will indemnify each holder of the Obligations on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by such Person in connection with such rescission or restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law. 4.4 Certain Additional Waivers. Each Guarantor agrees that such Guarantor shall have no right of recourse to security for the Obligations, except through the exercise of rights of subrogation pursuant to Section 4.2 and through the exercise of rights of contribution pursuant to Section 4.6. 4.5 Remedies. The Guarantors agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the holders of the Obligations, on the other hand, the Obligations may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in Section 9.2 (and shall be deemed to have become automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in said Section 9.2) for purposes of Section 4.1 notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such declaration (or preventing the Obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against any other Person and that, in the event of such declaration (or the Obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and payable), the Obligations (whether or not due and payable by any other Person) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for purposes of Section 4.1. 4.6 Rights of Contribution. The Guarantors hereby agree as among themselves that, if any Guarantor shall make an Excess Payment (as defined below), such Guarantor shall have a right of contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantor’s Contribution Share (as defined below) of such Excess Payment. The payment obligations of any Guarantor under this Section 4.6 shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full to the holders of the Obligations of the Obligations, and none of the Guarantors shall exercise any right or remedy under this Section 4.6 against any other Guarantor until payment and satisfaction in full of all of Obligations and termination of the Aggregate Commitments. For purposes of this Section 4.6, (a) “Guaranteed Obligations” shall mean any obligations arising under the other provisions of this Section 4; (b) “Excess Payment” shall mean the amount paid by any Guarantor in excess of its Pro Rata Share of any Guaranteed Obligations; (c) “Pro Rata Share” shall mean, for any
  86 CHAR1\1534998v8 Guarantor in respect of any payment of Guaranteed Obligations, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) as of the date of such payment of Guaranteed Obligations of (i) the amount by which the aggregate present fair salable value of all of its assets and properties exceeds the amount of all debts and liabilities of such Guarantor (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder) to (ii) the amount by which the aggregate present fair salable value of all assets and other properties of all of the Credit Parties exceeds the amount of all of the debts and liabilities (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of the Credit Parties hereunder) of the Credit Parties; provided, however, that, for purposes of calculating the Pro Rata Shares of the Guarantors in respect of any payment of Guaranteed Obligations, any Guarantor that became a Guarantor subsequent to the date of any such payment shall be deemed to have been a Guarantor on the date of such payment and the financial information for such Guarantor as of the date such Guarantor became a Guarantor shall be utilized for such Guarantor in connection with such payment; and (d) “Contribution Share” shall mean, for any Guarantor in respect of any Excess Payment made by any other Guarantor, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) as of the date of such Excess Payment of (i) the amount by which the aggregate present fair salable value of all of its assets and properties exceeds the amount of all debts and liabilities of such Guarantor (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder) to (ii) the amount by which the aggregate present fair salable value of all assets and other properties of the Credit Parties other than the maker of such Excess Payment exceeds the amount of all of the debts and liabilities (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of the Credit Parties) of the Credit Parties other than the maker of such Excess Payment; provided, however, that, for purposes of calculating the Contribution Shares of the Guarantors in respect of any Excess Payment, any Guarantor that became a Guarantor subsequent to the date of any such Excess Payment shall be deemed to have been a Guarantor on the date of such Excess Payment and the financial information for such Guarantor as of the date such Guarantor became a Guarantor shall be utilized for such Guarantor in connection with such Excess Payment. This Section 4.6 shall not be deemed to affect any right of subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or contribution that any Guarantor may have under applicable law against the Borrowers in respect of any payment of Guaranteed Obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all rights of contribution against any Guarantor shall terminate from and after such time, if ever, that such Guarantor shall be relieved of its obligations pursuant to Section 8.4. 4.7 Guarantee of Payment; Continuing Guarantee. The guarantee in this Section 4 is a guaranty of payment and not of collection, is a continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all Obligations whenever arising. 4.8 Keepwell. Each Credit Party that is a Qualified ECP Guarantor at the time this Section 4 by any Specified Credit Party becomes effective with respect to any Swap Obligation, hereby jointly and severally, absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support to each Specified Credit Party with respect to such Swap Obligation as may be needed by such Specified Credit Party from time to time to honor all of its obligations under the Credit Documents in respect of such Swap Obligation (but, in each case, only up to the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering such Qualified ECP Guarantor’s obligations and undertakings under this Section 4 voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount). The obligations and undertakings of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section 4.8 shall remain in full force and effect until the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full. Each Credit Party intends this Section 4.8 to constitute, and this Section 4.8 shall be deemed to constitute, a guarantee of the obligations of, and a “keepwell, support, or other agreement” for the benefit of, each Specified Credit Party for all purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act.

If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Banks and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Banks and the Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, with the consent of the Borrowers (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), meeting the qualifications set forth above; provided that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower Representative and the Banks that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (a) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Credit Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Banks or any Issuing Bank under any of the Credit Documents, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (b) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Bank and each Issuing Bank directly, until
  115 CHAR1\1534998v8 such time as the Required Banks appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section.

The fees payable by the Borrowers to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower Representative and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder and under the other Credit Documents, the provisions of this Section and Section 11.5 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.

(a) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Bank, each Issuing Bank and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Bank, such Issuing Bank, or any of their respective Affiliates to or for the credit or the account of any Credit Party against any and all of the obligations of such Person now or hereafter existing under this Credit Agreement, under the Notes, under any other Credit Document or otherwise, irrespective of whether such Bank or such Issuing Bank shall have made any demand hereunder or thereunder and although such obligations may be unmatured. Each Bank and each Issuing Bank agrees promptly to notify any affected Credit Party after any such set-off and application made by such Bank or such Issuing Bank; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of each Bank and each Issuing Bank under this Section 11.2 are in addition to other rights and remedies
  119 CHAR1\1534998v8 (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) that such Bank or such Issuing Bank may have.

(b) Assignments by Banks. Any Bank may at any time assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans (including for purposes of this subsection (b), participations in LOC Obligations and in Swingline Loans) at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions: (i) Minimum Amounts. (A) In the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Bank’s Commitment under any facility and/or the related Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Bank, an Affiliate of a Bank or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned.
  120 CHAR1\1534998v8 (B) In any case not described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of this Section, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Bank subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if “Trade Date” is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $5,000,000 in the case of any assignment in respect of the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount, or $1,000,000 in the case of any assignment in respect of the Term Facility or any Incremental Term Facility, in each case unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower Representative otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that concurrent assignments to members of an Assignee Group and concurrent assignments from members of an Assignee Group to a single assignee (or to an assignee and members of its Assignee Group) will be treated as a single assignment for purposes of determining whether such minimum amount has been met. (ii) Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Bank’s Loans and Commitments, and rights and obligations with respect thereto, assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not (A) apply to the Swingline Bank’s rights and obligations in respect of Swingline Loans or (B) prohibit any Bank from assigning all or a portion of its rights and obligations in respect of its Commitments (and the related Loans thereunder) on a non-pro rata basis. (iii) Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by subsection (b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition: (A) the consent of the Borrower Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (1) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (2) such assignment is to a Bank, an Affiliate of a Bank or an Approved Fund; provided that the Borrower Representative shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within ten (10) Business Days after having received notice thereof; (B) the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments in respect of (1) any unfunded Term Commitment or any Revolving Commitment if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Bank with a Commitment in respect of the applicable facility, an Affiliate of such Bank or an Approved Fund with respect to such Bank, or (2) any Term Loan or any Incremental Term Loan to a Person that is not a Bank, an Affiliate of a Bank or an Approved Fund; (C) the consent of each Issuing Bank (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for any assignment that increases the obligation of the assignee to participate in exposure under one or more Letters of Credit (whether or not then outstanding); and
  121 CHAR1\1534998v8 (D) the consent of the Swingline Bank (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for any assignment in respect of Revolving Loans and Revolving Commitments. (iv) Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment. The assignee, if it shall not be a Bank, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. (v) No Assignment to Certain Persons. No such assignment shall be made to (A) any Borrower, the Parent or any of the Parent’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries or (B) to any Defaulting Bank or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Bank hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B), or (C) to a natural person (or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of a natural person). (vi) Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Bank hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower Representative and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Bank, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Bank to the Administrative Agent or any Bank hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Bank hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Bank for all purposes of this Credit Agreement until such compliance occurs. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Credit Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Bank under this Credit Agreement, and the assigning Bank thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Credit Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Bank’s rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement, such Bank shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.8, 3.11, 3.12, 11.5 and 11.9 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment). Upon request, the Borrowers (at their expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Bank. Any assignment or transfer by a Bank of rights or obligations under this Credit Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes
  122 CHAR1\1534998v8 of this Credit Agreement as a sale by such Bank of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section. (c) Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non- fiduciary agent of the Borrowers (and such agency being solely for tax purposes), shall maintain at the Administrative Agent’s Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Banks, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans and LOC Obligations owing to, each Bank pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Banks shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Bank hereunder for all purposes of this Credit Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. In addition, the Administrative Agent shall maintain on the Register information regarding the designation, and revocation of designation, of any Bank as a Defaulting Bank. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers and any Bank at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (d) Participations. Any Bank may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower Representative or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person (or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of a natural person) or any Borrower, the Parent or any of the Parent’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Bank’s rights and/or obligations under this Credit Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and/or the Loans (including such Bank’s participations in LOC Obligations and/or Swingline Loans) owing to it); provided that (i) such Bank’s obligations under this Credit Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Bank shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the other Banks and the Issuing Banks shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank’s rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Bank sells such a participation shall provide that such Bank shall retain the sole right to enforce this Credit Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Credit Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Bank will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in Section 11.6(a) that affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, the Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.6, 3.9, 3.11 and 3.12 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.11(e) shall be delivered to the participating Bank)) to the same extent as if it were a Bank and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by Law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.2 as though it were a Bank, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 3.14 as though it were a Bank. Each Bank that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Credit Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Bank shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Credit Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Bank shall treat each Person whose
  123 CHAR1\1534998v8 name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Credit Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. (e) Limitation on Participant Rights. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.6, 3.9, 3.11 or 3.12 than the applicable Bank would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. (f) Certain Pledges. Any Bank may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Credit Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Bank, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Bank from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Bank as a party hereto. (g) Resignation as Issuing Bank or Swingline Bank after Assignment. (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time Wells Fargo Bank assigns all of its Commitments and Loans pursuant to subsection (b) above, Wells Fargo Bank may, upon sixty (60) days’ notice to the Borrower Representative, resign as the Swingline Bank. In the event of any such resignation as the Swingline Bank, the Borrower Representative shall be entitled to appoint from among the Banks a successor Swingline Bank hereunder; provided, however, that (x) no Bank shall be required to become the Swingline Bank without such Bank’s consent, and (y) no failure by the Borrower Representative to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of Wells Fargo Bank as the Swingline Bank. If Wells Fargo Bank resigns as the Swingline Bank, it shall retain all the rights of the Swingline Bank provided for hereunder with respect to Swingline Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require the Revolving Banks to make Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swingline Loans pursuant to Section 2.7. Upon the appointment of a successor Swingline Bank, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Swingline Bank. (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any Bank that is an Issuing Bank assigns all of its Commitments and Loans pursuant to subsection (b) above, such Bank may, upon 30 days’ notice to the Borrower Representative and the Banks, resign as an Issuing Bank. In the event of any such resignation as an Issuing Bank, the Borrower Representative shall be entitled to appoint from among the Revolving Banks a successor Issuing Bank or hereunder; provided, however, that (x) no Revolving Bank shall be required to become an Issuing Bank without such Revolving Bank’s consent, and (y) no failure by the Borrower Representative to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of such Bank as an Issuing Bank. If a Bank resigns as an Issuing Bank, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of an Issuing Bank hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit issued by it and outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as an Issuing Bank and all LOC Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the Revolving Banks to make Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.6(a)). Upon the
  124 CHAR1\1534998v8 appointment of a successor Issuing Bank, (A) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Issuing Bank, and (B) the successor Issuing Bank shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to such Bank to effectively assume the obligations of such Bank with respect to such Letters of Credit. (h) Disqualified Institutions. (i) No assignment shall be made to any Person that was a Disqualified Institution as of the date (the “Trade Date”) on which the applicable Bank entered into a binding agreement to sell and assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement to such Person (unless the Borrower Representative has consented to such assignment as otherwise contemplated by this Section 11.3, in which case such Person will not be considered a Disqualified Institution for the purpose of such assignment).

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Credit Agreement, Disqualified Institutions (A) will not (x) have the right to receive information, reports or other materials provided to the Banks by the Credit Parties, the Administrative

The rights and remedies provided herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the Administrative Agent or any Bank would otherwise have.

If (a) the Borrower Representative is entitled to replace a Bank pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.10, (b) a Bank (a “Non-Consenting Bank”) does not consent to a proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination with respect to any Credit Document that has been approved by the Required Banks as provided in Section 11.6 but requires unanimous consent of all Banks or all Banks directly affected thereby (as applicable), (c) any Bank is a Non-Extending Bank, (d) any Bank is a Defaulting Bank (or would be a Defaulting Bank but for the delivery by such Bank of the written notice described in clause (a) of the definition of “Defaulting Bank” unless such notices have been delivered by the Required Banks), (e) any Bank cannot provide an Alternative Currency or (f) any Bank does not consent to the designation of an Applicant Foreign Borrower as a Foreign Borrower that otherwise has been approved by the Required Banks, then the Borrowers may, at their sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Bank and the Administrative Agent, require such Bank to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 11.3), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement and the related Credit Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Bank, if a Bank accepts such assignment); provided that: (i) the Borrowers shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 11.3; (ii) such Bank shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and LOC Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Credit Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.12) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts);
