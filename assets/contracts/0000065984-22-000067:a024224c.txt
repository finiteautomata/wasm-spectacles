Neither failure nor delay by the Company or the Administrative Agent or the Mortgage Trustee to exercise any right or remedy provided herein or by statute or at law or in equity shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other right or remedy. Each System Operating Company also hereby irrevocably waives, to the extent that it may do so under applicable law, any defense based on the adequacy of a remedy at law that may be asserted as a bar to the remedy of specific performance in any action brought against such System Operating Company for specific performance of this Assignment or the Availability Agreement by the Company, by the Administrative Agent, by the Mortgage Trustee, or for their benefit by a receiver or trustee appointed for the Company or in respect of all or a substantial part of the Company’s assets under the bankruptcy or insolvency law of any jurisdiction to which the Company is or its assets are subject.

If any party elects to give the Administrative Agent or the Mortgage Trustee e-mail or facsimile instructions (or instructions by a similar electronic method) and the Administrative Agent or the Mortgage Trustee, in either case, in its discretion, elects to act upon such instructions, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, the Administrative Agent’s or the Mortgage Trustee’s, as applicable, understanding of such instructions shall be deemed controlling.

7.1  Term Loan Credit Agreement and Mortgage Terms and Conditions. The Administrative Agent and the Mortgage Trustee enter into and accept this Assignment upon the terms and conditions set forth in Article VII of the Term Loan Credit Agreement and Article Ten of the Restated Mortgage, respectively, with the same force and effect as if those terms and conditions were repeated at length herein and made applicable to the Administrative Agent and the Mortgage Trustee in respect of this Assignment and the trusts hereunder and in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by the Administrative Agent or the Mortgage Trustee hereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent

and the Mortgage Trustee assume no responsibility as to the validity or enforceability hereof or for the correctness of the recitals of fact contained herein or in the Availability Agreement, which shall be taken as the statements, representations and warranties of the Company and the System Operating Companies.
7.2  Enforcement Action. At any time that any Term Loan has not been paid when due and payable, or the interest on any Term Loan or any other amount payable under the Term Loan Credit Agreement has not been paid within five (5) Business Days after the same became due and payable, the Administrative Agent, upon the request of the Majority Lenders, may proceed, either in its own name and as Administrative Agent or otherwise, to protect and enforce the rights of the Administrative Agent and those of the Company under this Assignment and the Availability Agreement by suit in equity, action at law or other appropriate proceedings, whether for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained herein or in the Availability Agreement or otherwise, and whether or not the Company shall have complied with any of the provisions hereof or thereof or proceeded to take any action authorized or permitted under applicable law; provided that the Administrative Agent shall take no such action until 60 days after receipt of such request during which time such default in payment shall not have been cured nor shall an inconsistent direction have been given to the Administrative Agent by the Majority Lenders. Each and every remedy of the Administrative Agent shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and shall be in addition to any other remedy given hereunder or under the Term Loan Credit Agreement or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute. No Lender shall have any right directly to enforce the security interests granted by this Assignment. The Mortgage Trustee, upon receiving notice from the Administrative Agent that the Administrative Agent does not intend to take the action contemplated by this Section 7.2, may proceed in its own name to protect the Mortgage Trustee’s rights and those of the Company under this Assignment by suit in equity, action at law or other appropriate proceedings, whether for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained in this Assignment or otherwise, and whether or not the Company shall have complied with any of the provisions hereof or proceeded to take any action authorized or permitted under applicable law.
7.3  Attorney-in-Fact. The Company hereby constitutes the Administrative Agent and the Mortgage Trustee, with the authority to act without the other, its true and lawful attorney, irrevocably, with full power (in such attorney’s name or otherwise), at any time when an Event of Default under the Term Loan Credit Agreement or an Event of Default under the Restated Mortgage has occurred and is continuing, to enforce any of the obligations contained herein or in the Availability Agreement or to take any action or institute any proceedings that to the Administrative Agent or the Mortgage Trustee may seem necessary or advisable in the premises.
