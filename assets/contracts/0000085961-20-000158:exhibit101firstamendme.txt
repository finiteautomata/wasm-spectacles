(c)Ryder shall have paid all fees, charges and disbursements of counsel to the Administrative Agent (directly to such counsel, if so requested by the Administrative Agent) to the extent invoiced prior to or on the date hereof, plus such additional amounts of such fees, charges and disbursements as shall constitute its reasonable estimate of such fees, charges and disbursements incurred or to be incurred by it through the closing proceedings (provided, that, such estimate shall not thereafter preclude a final settling of accounts between Ryder and the Administrative Agent).
3.Miscellaneous.
(a)The Loan Documents, and the obligations of the Borrowers under the Loan Documents, are hereby ratified and confirmed and shall remain in full force and effect according to their terms. This Agreement is a Loan Document.
(b)Each Borrower (i) acknowledges and consents to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (ii) affirms all of its obligations under the Loan Documents, and (iii) agrees that this Agreement and all documents executed in connection herewith do not operate to reduce or discharge its obligations under the Loan Documents.
(c)Each Borrower represents and warrants that:
(i) Such Borrower has taken all necessary corporate or other organizational action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement.
(ii) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by such Borrower and constitutes a valid and legally obligation of such Borrower, enforceable against such Borrower in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability is limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws relating to or affecting generally the enforcement of creditors’ rights and except to the extent that availability of the remedy of specific performance or injunctive relief is subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.
(iii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by such Borrower and the consummation by such Borrower of the transactions contemplated hereby do not require any approval or consent of, or filing with, any governmental agency or authority other than those already obtained.
(iv) After giving effect to this Agreement, (A) the representations and warranties of such Borrower contained in the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, or which are contained in any document furnished at any time under or in connection therewith, are true and correct in all material respects (and in all respects if any such representation and warranty is already qualified by materiality or reference to Material Adverse Effect) on and as of the date of this Agreement, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct in all material respects (and in all respects if any such representation and warranty is already qualified by materiality or reference to Material Adverse Effect) as of such earlier date, and (B) no Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic imagine means (e.g. “pdf” or “tif”) shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
(e)If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (i) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (ii) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
