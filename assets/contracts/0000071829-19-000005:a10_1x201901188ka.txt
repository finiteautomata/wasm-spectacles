NOW THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Borrowers, Administrative Agent, and Lenders hereto hereby agree as follows:
Section 1.    Limited Waiver. In reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Limited Waiver, subject to the conditions precedent set forth in Section 2 hereof, Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders hereby permanently waive the Specified Defaults for all purposes under the Loan Documents. The waiver provided in this Section 1 shall apply solely with regard to the Specified Defaults, and nothing contained in this Limited Waiver shall be deemed a consent to, or waiver of, any other action or inaction of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party that constitutes (or would constitute) a violation of or a departure from any provision of the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, or which constitutes (or would constitute) a Default or Event of Default. The waiver described in this Section 1 is a one-time waiver limited to the Specified Defaults. Neither Lenders nor Administrative Agent shall be obligated to grant any future waivers, consents or amendments with respect to Section 8.01(e) of the Credit Agreement or any other provision of the Credit Agreement or of any other Loan Document. Other than the waiver provided for in this Section 1, the Borrowers hereby agree and acknowledge that no course of dealing and no delay in exercising any right, power or remedy conferred on Administrative Agent or any Lender in the Credit Agreement or in any other Loan Document or now or hereafter existing at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise shall operate as a waiver of or otherwise prejudice any such right, power or remedy.

2.2    Interest. Administrative Agent shall have received evidence satisfactory to it that Newpark has deposited with the Trustee funds sufficient to repay the Missed Interest Payments and has thereby completed all steps within its control to make all payments required to cure the Indenture Defaults.
2.3    No Default.     After giving effect to the waiver set forth in Section 1 hereof, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing.
Section 3.    Representations and Warranties of Borrowers. To induce Lenders and Administrative Agent to enter into this Limited Waiver, Borrowers hereby represent and warrant to Lenders and Administrative Agent as of the Effective Date as follows:
3.1    Reaffirmation of Existing Representations and Warranties. After giving effect to the waiver set forth in Section 1 hereof, each representation and warranty of each Borrower contained in the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents is true and correct in all material respects (except to the extent that such representations and warranties are qualified by materiality, in which case such representations and warranties are true and correct in all respects) on the date hereof, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they were true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date.
3.2    Effect on Loan Documents. The Credit Agreement and all other Loan Documents remain in full force and effect as originally executed. Except as provided in Section 1 hereof, nothing herein shall act as a waiver of any of Administrative Agent’s or any Lender’s rights under the Loan Documents, including the waiver of any other Default or Event of Default. The Loan Parties acknowledge

3.4    Acknowledgment of No Defenses.

The waiver contemplated hereby shall not limit or impair any Lien securing the Obligations, each of which is hereby ratified and affirmed. The execution, delivery and effectiveness of this Limited Waiver shall not, except as provided herein, operate as a waiver of any right, power or remedy of any Lender or Administrative Agent under any of the Loan Documents, nor, except as provided in Section 1 hereof, constitute a waiver or amendment of any provision of any of the Loan Documents.
4.2    Parties in Interest. All of the terms and provisions of this Limited Waiver shall bind, and inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
4.3    Counterparts. This Limited Waiver may be executed in counterparts, including, without limitation, by electronic signature, and all parties need not execute the same counterpart.
