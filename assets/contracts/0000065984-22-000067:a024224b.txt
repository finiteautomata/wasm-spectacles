MATURITY DATE: November 6, 2023    PRINCIPAL AMOUNT: $
SYSTEM ENERGY RESOURCES, INC.
FIRST MORTGAGE BONDS, 2022 CREDIT AGREEMENT COLLATERAL SERIES
DUE NOVEMBER 6, 2023
SYSTEM ENERGY RESOURCES, INC., a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Arkansas (herein referred to as the “Company,” which term includes any successor Person under the Mortgage referred to below), for value received, hereby promises to pay to
or registered assigns, the principal amount specified above on the Maturity Date set forth above without interest.
Payment of the principal of this Security shall be made upon presentation of this Security at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in The City of New York, in the State of New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.
All terms used in this Security not otherwise defined herein which are defined in the Mortgage shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Mortgage and in the Officer’s Certificate establishing the terms of the Securities of this series (the “Series Officer’s Certificate”).
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the “Securities”), issued and to be issued in one or more series under a Mortgage and Deed of Trust dated as of June 15, 1977 (as amended, restated and supplemented by the Twenty-fourth Supplemental Indenture thereto dated as of September 1, 2012, as previously amended and supplemented, and as further supplemented by the Series Officer’s Certificate, herein called the “Mortgage,” which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (herein called the “Trustee,” which term includes any successor trustee under the Mortgage), and reference is hereby made to the Mortgage, for a statement of the property mortgaged, pledged and held in trust, the nature and extent of the security, the conditions upon which the Lien of the Mortgage may be released and to the Mortgage, Board Resolutions and Series Officer’s Certificate, for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. The acceptance of this Security shall be deemed to constitute the consent and agreement
    A-1    


by the Holder thereof to all of the terms and provisions of the Mortgage. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof.
This Security is not transferable except to a successor administrative agent under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, any such transfer to be made in the manner prescribed in the Mortgage by the registered owner hereof in person, or by his duly authorized attorney, at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, upon surrender and cancellation of this Security, together with a written instrument of transfer whenever required by the Company duly executed by the registered owner or by its duly authorized attorney, and thereupon a new fully registered Security of the same series will be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor as provided in the Mortgage. The Company and the Trustee may deem and treat the person in whose name this Security is registered as the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of receiving payment and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

The Securities of this series have been issued in order to evidence the Company’s obligation to make certain payments under the Term Loan Credit Agreement.

The obligation of the Company to make any payment of principal of the Securities of this series, whether at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise, shall be reduced by the amount of any reduction of Commitments (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) under the Term Loan Credit Agreement due to any repayment of Term Loans (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) pursuant to Section 2.05 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement and any prepayment of Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.09, so that the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of this series held by the Administrative Agent after such reduction is as close as possible to, but not less than, the sum of the aggregate Commitments after such reductions plus five (5) percent of the aggregate Commitments after such reduction.

The Trustee may conclusively presume that the obligation of the Company to pay the principal of the Securities of this series as the same shall become due and payable shall have been fully satisfied and discharged unless and until the Trustee shall have received a written notice (which may be a facsimile followed by a hard copy) from the Administrative Agent, signed by an authorized officer, stating that the corresponding payment of principal of or interest on the Term Loans has become due and payable and has not been fully paid and specifying the amount of funds required to make such payment.

In the event that any outstanding Term Loans, all interest thereon and all other amounts payable under the Term Loan Credit Agreement shall become immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 6.02 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under Section 6.01(a) of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, the Securities of this series then outstanding shall be redeemed by the Company, on the date such Term Loan, all interest thereon and other amounts payable under the Term Loan Credit Agreement shall have become immediately due and payable, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof. In the event that any Term Loans are repaid pursuant to Section 2.09 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, Securities of this series, in a principal amount equal, as nearly as practicable, to one hundred and five percent (105%) of the Term Loans being repaid, shall be redeemed immediately at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof.

The Trustee may conclusively presume that no redemption of the Securities of this series is required pursuant to the preceding paragraph unless and until the Trustee shall have received a written notice (which may be a facsimile followed by a hard copy) from the Administrative Agent, signed by an
    A-2    


authorized officer thereof, stating that, as the case may be, the outstanding Term Loans, all interest thereof and all other amounts payable under the Term Loan Credit Agreement have become immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 6.02 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under Section 6.01(a) of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, or that the Term Loans (or any portion thereof) are to be repaid pursuant to Section 2.09 of the Term Loan Credit Agreement and specifying the date fixed for such repayment and the principal amount thereof. Said notice shall also contain a waiver of notice of such redemption by the Administrative Agent, as the holder of all the Securities of this series then outstanding. As a condition to any redemption pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the Administrative Agent is required to present the Securities of this series to the Trustee for payment.

The Company hereby waives its right to have any notice of any redemption pursuant to the preceding paragraph state that such notice is subject to the receipt of the redemption moneys by the Trustee before the date fixed for redemption. Any such notice shall not be conditional.

The Mortgage contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Security upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Mortgage and the Series Officer’s Certificate.

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Mortgage.

The Mortgage permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of this series at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time Outstanding to be directly affected thereby. The Mortgage also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Mortgage and certain past defaults under the Mortgage and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.

As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Mortgage, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Mortgage or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless (i) such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, (ii) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time Outstanding in respect of which an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (a) shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as the Trustee and (b) offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and (iii) the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Securities of all series at the time Outstanding in respect of which an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing a direction inconsistent with such request; and the Trustee shall have failed to institute any such proceeding for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to
    A-3    


any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.

No reference herein to the Mortgage and no provision of this Security or of the Mortgage shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.

This Security shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (including without limitation Section 5-1401 of the New York General Obligations Law or any successor to such statute), except to the extent that the Trust Indenture Act shall be applicable.

As provided in the Mortgage, no recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any Securities, or any part thereof, or for any claim based thereon or otherwise in respect thereof, or of the indebtedness represented thereby, or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement under the Mortgage, against, and no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, or be incurred by, any incorporator, shareholder, member, limited partner, officer, manager or director, as such, past, present or future of the Company or of any predecessor or successor of the Company (either directly or through the Company or a predecessor or successor of the Company), whether by virtue of any constitutional provision, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise; it being expressly agreed and understood that the Mortgage and all the Securities are solely corporate obligations and that any such personal liability is hereby expressly waived and released as a condition of, and as part of the consideration for, the execution of the Mortgage and the issuance of the Securities.

Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to herein by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Mortgage or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

    A-4    


IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed.
