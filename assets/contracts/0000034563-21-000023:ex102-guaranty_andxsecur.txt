(i) Each of the Guarantors waives any right (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived) to require Agent, any other member of the Lender Group, or any Bank Product Provider to (i) proceed against any other Grantor or any other Person, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security held from any other Grantor or any other Person, or
  -13- (iii) protect, secure, perfect, or insure any security interest or Lien on any property subject thereto or exhaust any right to take any action against any other Grantor, any other Person, or any collateral, or (iv) pursue any other remedy in any member of the Lender Group's or any Bank Product Provider's power whatsoever. Each of the Guarantors waives promptness and diligence and notice of acceptance and any other notice with respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations. Each of the Guarantors waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any Grantor or any other Person, other than payment of the Guarantied Obligations to the extent of such payment, based on or arising out of the disability of any Grantor or any other Person, or the validity, legality, or unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any Grantor other than payment of the Obligations to the extent of such payment. Agent may, at the election of the Required Lenders and in accordance with the terms of the relevant Loan Documents, foreclose upon any Collateral held by Agent by one or more judicial or non-judicial sales or other dispositions, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable or otherwise fails to comply with applicable law or may exercise any other right or remedy Agent, any other member of the Lender Group, or any Bank Product Provider may have against any Grantor or any other Person, or any security, in each case, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any of the Guarantors hereunder except to the extent the Guarantied Obligations have been paid. (ii) Each of the Guarantors waives all presentments, demands for performance, protests and notices, including notices of nonperformance, notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this Guaranty, and notices of the existence, creation, or incurring of new or additional Obligations or other financial accommodations, in each case, except with respect to any notices expressly required or provided pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document. Each of the Guarantors waives notice of any Default or Event of Default under any of the Loan Documents. Each of the Guarantors assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of each Grantor's financial condition and assets and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations and the nature, scope, and extent of the risks which each of the Guarantors assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that neither Agent nor any of the other members of the Lender Group nor any Bank Product Provider shall have any duty to advise any of the Guarantors of information known to them regarding such circumstances or risks. (iii) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor hereby waives: (A) any right to assert against any member of the Lender Group or any Bank Product Provider, any defense (legal or equitable) (other than the defense that all of the Guarantied Obligations have been paid in full), set-off, counterclaim, or claim which each Guarantor may now or at any time hereafter have against any Borrower or any other party liable to any member of the Lender Group or any Bank Product Provider, (B) any defense, set-off, counterclaim, or claim, of any kind or nature, arising directly or indirectly from the present or future lack of perfection, sufficiency, validity, or enforceability of the Guarantied Obligations or any security therefor, (C) any right or defense arising by reason of any claim or defense based upon an election of remedies by any member of the Lender Group or any Bank Product Provider including any defense based upon an impairment or elimination of such Guarantor's rights of subrogation, reimbursement, contribution, or indemnity of such Guarantor against any Borrower or other guarantors or sureties, and (D) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting such Guarantor's liability hereunder or the enforcement thereof, and any act which shall defer or delay the operation
  -14- of any statute of limitations applicable to the Guarantied Obligations shall similarly operate to defer or delay the operation of such statute of limitations applicable to such Guarantor's liability hereunder. (iv) No Guarantor will exercise any rights that it may now or hereafter acquire against any Grantor or any other guarantor that arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of such Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty, including any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of Agent, any other member of the Lender Group, or any Bank Product Provider against any Grantor or any other guarantor or any Collateral, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law, including the right to take or receive from any Grantor or any other guarantor, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security solely on account of such claim, remedy or right, unless and until all of the Guarantied Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full in cash and all of the Commitments have been terminated. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor in violation of the immediately preceding sentence, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of Agent, for the benefit of the Lender Group and the Bank Product Providers, and shall forthwith be paid to Agent to be credited and applied to the Guarantied Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, or to be held as Collateral for any Guarantied Obligations or other amounts payable under this Guaranty thereafter arising. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Guaranty, no Guarantor may exercise any rights of subrogation, contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or other similar rights against, and may not proceed or seek recourse against or with respect to any property or asset of, any other Grantor (the "Foreclosed Grantor"), including after payment in full of the Obligations, if all or any portion of the Obligations have been satisfied in connection with an exercise of remedies in respect of the Equity Interests of such Foreclosed Grantor whether pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise. (v) Each of the Guarantors hereby acknowledges and affirms that it understands that to the extent the Guarantied Obligations are secured by Real Property located in California, Guarantors shall be liable for the full amount of the liability hereunder notwithstanding the foreclosure on such Real Property by trustee sale or any other reason impairing such Guarantor's right to proceed against any Loan Party. In accordance with Section 2856 of the California Civil Code or any similar laws of any other applicable jurisdiction, each of the Guarantors hereby waives until such time as the Guarantied Obligations have been paid in full: (1) all rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification, and contribution and any other rights and defenses that are or may become available to the Guarantors by reason of Sections 2787 to 2855, inclusive, 2899, and 3433 of the California Civil Code or any similar laws of any other applicable jurisdiction; (2) all rights and defenses that the Guarantors may have because the Guarantied Obligations are secured by Real Property located in California, meaning, among other things, that: (A) Agent, the other members of the Lender Group, and the Bank Product Providers may collect from the Guarantors without first foreclosing on any real or personal property collateral pledged by any Borrower or any other Grantor, and (B) if Agent, on behalf of
  -15- the Lender Group, forecloses on any Real Property collateral pledged by any Borrower or any other Grantor, (1) the amount of the Guarantied Obligations may be reduced only by the price for which that collateral is sold at the foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth more than the sale price, and (2) the Lender Group may collect from the Guarantors even if, by foreclosing on the Real Property collateral, Agent or the other members of the Lender Group have destroyed or impaired any right the Guarantors may have to collect from any other Grantor, it being understood that this is an unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses the Guarantors may have because the Guarantied Obligations are secured by Real Property (including, without limitation, any rights or defenses based upon Sections 580a, 580d, or 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure or any similar laws of any other applicable jurisdiction); and (3) all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by Agent, the other members of the Lender Group, and the Bank Product Providers, even though that election of remedies, such as a non-judicial foreclosure with respect to security for the Guarantied Obligations, has destroyed Guarantors' rights of subrogation and reimbursement against any Grantor by the operation of Section 580d of the California Code of Civil Procedure or any similar laws of any other applicable jurisdiction or otherwise. (vi) Each of the Guarantors represents, warrants, and agrees that each of the waivers set forth above is made with full knowledge of its significance and consequences and that if any of such waivers are determined to be contrary to any applicable law or public policy, such waivers shall be effective to the maximum extent permitted by law. (vii) The provisions in this Section 2 which refer to certain sections of the California Civil Code or the California Code of Civil Procedure are included in this Guaranty solely out of an abundance of caution and shall not be construed to mean that any of the above- referenced provisions of California law are in any way applicable to this Guaranty. 3. Grant of Security. Each Grantor hereby unconditionally grants, collaterally assigns, and pledges to Agent, for the benefit of each member of the Lender Group and each of the Bank Product Providers, to secure the Secured Obligations (whether now existing or hereafter arising), a continuing security interest (hereinafter referred to as the "Security Interest") in all personal property and Fixtures of such Grantor, wherever located and whether now or hereafter existing and whether now owned or hereafter acquired, of every kind and description, tangible or intangible, including, without limitation, the following (the "Collateral"): (a) all of such Grantor's Accounts; (b) all of such Grantor's Books; (c) all of such Grantor's Chattel Paper; (d) all of such Grantor's Commercial Tort Claims; (e) all of such Grantor's Deposit Accounts; (f) all of such Grantor's Equipment;
  -16- (g) all of such Grantor's Farm Products; (h) all of such Grantor's Fixtures; (i) all of such Grantor's General Intangibles; (j) all of such Grantor's Inventory; (k) all of such Grantor's Investment Property; (l) all of such Grantor's Titled Collateral; (m) all of such Grantor's Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Licenses; (n) all of such Grantor's Negotiable Collateral (including all of such Grantor's Pledged Notes); (o) all of such Grantor's Pledged Interests (including all of such Grantor's Pledged Operating Agreements and Pledged Partnership Agreements); (p) all of such Grantor's Securities Accounts; (q) all of such Grantor's Supporting Obligations; (r) all of such Grantor's money, Cash Equivalents, or other assets of such Grantor that now or hereafter come into the possession, custody, or control of Agent (or its agent or designee) or any other member of the Lender Group; (s) all other tangible and intangible personal property and Fixtures of such Grantor (whether or not subject to the Code), including, without limitation, all bank and other accounts and all cash and all investments therein, all proceeds, products, offspring, accessions, rents, profits, income, benefits, substitutions and replacements of and to any of the property of such Grantor described in the preceding clauses of this Section 3 (including, without limitation, any proceeds of insurance thereon and all causes of action, claims and warranties now or hereafter held by such Grantor in respect of any of the items listed above), and all books, correspondence, files and other Records, including, without limitation, all tapes, disks, cards, software, data and computer programs in the possession or under the control of such Grantor or any other Person from time to time acting for such Grantor that at any time evidence or contain information relating to any of the property described in the preceding clauses of this Section 3 or are otherwise necessary or helpful in the collection or realization thereof; and (t) all of the Proceeds and products, whether tangible or intangible, of any of the foregoing, including proceeds of insurance or Commercial Tort Claims covering or relating to any or all of the foregoing, and any and all Accounts, Books, Chattel Paper, Deposit Accounts, Equipment, Farm Products, Fixtures, General Intangibles, Inventory, Investment Property, Intellectual Property, Negotiable Collateral, Pledged Interests, Securities Accounts, Supporting Obligations, money, or other tangible or intangible property resulting from the sale, lease, license,
  -17- exchange, collection, or other disposition of any of the foregoing, the proceeds of any award in condemnation with respect to any of the foregoing, any rebates or refunds, whether for taxes or otherwise, and all proceeds of any such proceeds, or any portion thereof or interest therein, and the proceeds thereof, and all proceeds of any loss of, damage to, or destruction of the above, whether insured or not insured, and, to the extent not otherwise included, any indemnity, warranty, or guaranty payable by reason of loss or damage to, or otherwise with respect to any of the foregoing (the "Proceeds"). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the term "Proceeds" includes whatever is receivable or received when Investment Property or proceeds are sold, exchanged, collected, or otherwise disposed of, whether such disposition is voluntary or involuntary, and includes proceeds of any indemnity or guaranty payable to any Grantor or Agent from time to time with respect to any of the Investment Property. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the term "Collateral" shall not include, and the security interest shall not attach to : (i) any rights or interest in any contract, lease, permit, license, or license agreement covering real or personal property of any Grantor if under the terms of such contract, lease, permit, license, or license agreement, or applicable law with respect thereto, the grant of a security interest or lien therein is prohibited or restricted as a matter of law or under the terms of such contract, lease, permit, license, or license agreement, or would violate or invalidate any such contract, lease, permit, license or license agreement (or create a right of termination in favor of any other party thereto (other than a Grantor)), and such prohibition or restriction has not been waived or the consent of the other party to such contract, lease, permit, license, or license agreement has not been obtained (provided, that (A) the foregoing exclusions of this clause (i) shall in no way be construed (1) to apply to the extent that any described prohibition or restriction is ineffective under Section 9-406, 9-407, 9- 408, or 9-409 of the Code or other applicable law, or (2) to apply to the extent that any consent or waiver has been obtained that would permit Agent's security interest or lien to attach notwithstanding the prohibition or restriction on the pledge of such contract, lease, permit, license, or license agreement and (B) the foregoing exclusions of this clause (i) shall in no way be construed to limit, impair, or otherwise affect any of Agent's, any other member of the Lender Group's or any Bank Product Provider's continuing security interests in and liens upon any rights or interests of any Grantor in or to (1) monies due or to become due under or in connection with any described contract, lease, permit, license, license agreement, or Equity Interests (including any Accounts or Equity Interests), or (2) any proceeds from the sale, license, lease, or other dispositions of any such contract, lease, permit, license, license agreement, or Equity Interests); (ii) any United States intent-to-use trademark applications to the extent that, and solely during the period in which, the grant of a security interest therein would impair the validity or enforceability of such intent-to-use trademark applications under applicable federal law; provided, that upon submission and acceptance by the PTO of an amendment to allege use pursuant to 15 U.S.C. Section 1060(a) (or any successor provision), such intent-to-use trademark application shall be considered Collateral; (iii) any Excluded Account; or (iv) the Houston Assets. 4. Security for Secured Obligations. The Security Interest created hereby secures the payment and performance of the Secured Obligations, whether now existing or arising hereafter. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this Agreement secures the payment of all amounts which constitute part of the Secured Obligations and would be owed by Grantors, or any of them, to Agent, the Lender Group, the Bank Product Providers or any of them, but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable (in whole or in part) as a claim in an Insolvency
  -18- Proceeding involving any Grantor due to the existence of such Insolvency Proceeding. Further, the Security Interest created hereby encumbers each Grantor's right, title, and interest in all Collateral, whether now owned by such Grantor or hereafter acquired, obtained, developed, or created by such Grantor and wherever located. 5. Grantors Remain Liable. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, (a) each of the Grantors shall remain liable under the contracts and agreements to which it is a party included in the Collateral, including the Pledged Operating Agreements and the Pledged Partnership Agreements, to perform all of the duties and obligations thereunder to the same extent as if this Agreement had not been executed, (b) the exercise by Agent or any other member of the Lender Group of any of the rights hereunder shall not release any Grantor from any of its duties or obligations under such contracts and agreements included in the Collateral, and (c) none of the members of the Lender Group shall have any obligation or liability under such contracts and agreements included in the Collateral by reason of this Agreement, nor shall any of the members of the Lender Group be obligated to perform any of the obligations or duties of any Grantors thereunder or to take any action to collect or enforce any claim for payment assigned hereunder. Until an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Credit Agreement, or any other Loan Document, Grantors shall have the right to possession and enjoyment of the Collateral, subject to and upon the terms hereof and of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is the intention of the parties hereto that record and beneficial ownership of the Pledged Interests, including all voting, consensual, dividend, and distribution rights, shall remain in the applicable Grantor until (i) the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, and (ii) Agent has notified the applicable Grantor of Agent's election to exercise such rights with respect to the Pledged Interests pursuant to Section 16. 6. Representations and Warranties. In order to induce Agent to enter into this Agreement for the benefit of the Lender Group and the Bank Product Providers, each Grantor makes the following representations and warranties to the Lender Group which shall be true, correct, and complete, in all material respects (except that such materiality qualifier shall not be applicable to any representations and warranties that already are qualified or modified by materiality in the text thereof), as of the Closing Date, and shall be true, correct, and complete, in all material respects (except that such materiality qualifier shall not be applicable to any representations and warranties that already are qualified or modified by materiality in the text thereof), as of the date of the making of each Revolving Loan (or other extension of credit) made thereafter, as though made on and as of the date of such Revolving Loan (or other extension of credit) (except to the extent that such representations and warranties relate solely to an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all material respects (except that such materiality qualifier shall not be applicable to any representations and warranties that already are qualified or modified by materiality in the text thereof) as of such earlier date) and such representations and warranties shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement: (a) The name (within the meaning of Section 9-503 of the Code) and jurisdiction of organization of each Grantor is set forth on Schedule 7 (as such Schedule may be updated from time to time to reflect changes resulting from transactions permitted under the Loan Documents).

Except to the extent a security interest in the Collateral cannot be perfected by the filing of a financing statement under the Code, all filings and other actions necessary or desirable, in Agent's Permitted Discretion, to perfect and protect such security interest have been duly taken or will have been taken upon the filing of financing statements listing each applicable Grantor, as a debtor, and Agent, as secured party, in the jurisdictions listed next to such Grantor's name on Schedule 11.

  -21- (j) (i) Except for the Security Interest created hereby, each Grantor is and will at all times be the sole holder of record and the legal and beneficial owner, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens, of the Pledged Interests indicated on Schedule 5 as being owned by such Grantor and, when acquired by such Grantor, any Pledged Interests acquired after the Closing Date, (ii) all of the Pledged Interests are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and the Pledged Interests constitute or will constitute the percentage of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests of the Pledged Companies of such Grantor identified on Schedule 5 as supplemented or modified by any Pledged Interests Addendum or any Joinder to this Agreement, (iii) such Grantor has the right and requisite authority to pledge, the Investment Property pledged by such Grantor to Agent as provided herein, (iv) all actions necessary or desirable, in Agent's Permitted Discretion, to perfect and establish the first priority (subject only to Permitted Liens to the extent any such Liens would have priority over Agent's Liens pursuant to any applicable law or an agreement expressly permitted under any of the Loan Documents to have such senior priority) of, or otherwise protect, Agent's Liens in the Investment Property, and the proceeds thereof, have been duly taken, upon (A) the execution and delivery of this Agreement, (B) the taking of possession by Agent (or its agent or designee) of any certificates representing the Pledged Interests, to the extent such Pledged Interests are represented by certificates, together with undated powers (or other documents of transfer acceptable to Agent) endorsed in blank by the applicable Grantor, (C) the filing of financing statements in the applicable jurisdiction set forth on Schedule 11 for such Grantor with respect to the Pledged Interests of such Grantor that are not represented by certificates, and (D) with respect to any Securities Accounts, the delivery of Control Agreements with respect thereto, and (v) each Grantor has delivered to and deposited with Agent all certificates representing the Pledged Interests owned by such Grantor to the extent such Pledged Interests are represented by certificates, and undated powers (or other documents of transfer acceptable to Agent) endorsed in blank with respect to such certificates.

Agent's Duties. The powers conferred on Agent hereunder are solely to protect Agent's interest in the Collateral, for the benefit of the Lender Group and the Bank Product Providers, and shall not impose any duty upon Agent to exercise any such powers. Except for the safe custody of any Collateral in its actual possession and the accounting for moneys actually received by it hereunder, Agent shall have no duty as to any Collateral or as to the taking of any necessary steps to preserve rights against prior parties or any other rights pertaining to any Collateral. Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any Collateral in its actual possession if such Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which Agent accords its own property. 14. Collection of Accounts, General Intangibles and Negotiable Collateral. At any time upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Agent or Agent's designee may (a) make direct verification from Account Debtors with respect to any or all Accounts that are part of the Collateral, (b) notify Account Debtors of any Grantor that the Accounts, General Intangibles, Chattel Paper or Negotiable Collateral of such Grantor have been assigned to Agent, for the benefit of the Lender Group and the Bank Product Providers, or that Agent has a security
  -34- interest therein, or (c) collect the Accounts, General Intangibles and Negotiable Collateral of any Grantor directly, and any collection costs and expenses shall constitute part of such Grantor's Secured Obligations under the Loan Documents. 15. Disposition of Pledged Interests by Agent. None of the Pledged Interests existing as of the date of this Agreement are, and none of the Pledged Interests hereafter acquired on the date of acquisition thereof will be, registered or qualified under the various federal or state securities laws of the United States and disposition thereof after an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing may be restricted to one or more private (instead of public) sales in view of the lack of such registration. Each Grantor understands that in connection with such disposition, Agent may approach only a restricted number of potential purchasers and further understands that a sale under such circumstances may yield a lower price for the Pledged Interests than if the Pledged Interests were registered and qualified pursuant to federal and state securities laws and sold on the open market. Each Grantor, therefore, agrees that: (a) if Agent shall, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, sell or cause the Pledged Interests or any portion thereof to be sold at a private sale, Agent shall have the right to rely upon the advice and opinion of any nationally recognized brokerage or investment firm (but shall not be obligated to seek such advice and the failure to do so shall not be considered in determining the commercial reasonableness of such action) as to the best manner in which to offer the Pledged Interest or any portion thereof for sale and as to the best price reasonably obtainable at the private sale thereof, and (b) such reliance shall be conclusive evidence that Agent has handled the disposition in a commercially reasonable manner. 16. Voting and Other Rights in Respect of Pledged Interests. (a) Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, (i) Agent may, at its option, and in addition to all rights and remedies available to Agent under any other agreement, at law, in equity, or otherwise, exercise all voting rights, or any other ownership or consensual rights (including any dividend or distribution rights) in respect of the Pledged Interests owned by such Grantor, but under no circumstances is Agent obligated by the terms of this Agreement to exercise such rights, and (ii) if Agent duly exercises its right to vote any of such Pledged Interests, each Grantor hereby appoints Agent, such Grantor's true and lawful attorney- in-fact and IRREVOCABLE PROXY to vote such Pledged Interests in any manner Agent deems advisable for or against all matters submitted or which may be submitted to a vote of shareholders, partners or members, as the case may be. The power-of-attorney and proxy granted hereby is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable. (b) For so long as any Grantor shall have the right to vote the Pledged Interests owned by it, such Grantor covenants and agrees that it will not, without the prior written consent of Agent, vote or take any consensual action with respect to such Pledged Interests which would reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the rights of Agent, the other members of the Lender Group, or the Bank Product Providers, or the value of the Pledged Interests. 17. Remedies. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default: (a) Agent may, and, at the instruction of the Required Lenders, shall exercise in respect of the Collateral, in addition to other rights and remedies provided for herein, in the
  -35- other Loan Documents, or otherwise available to it, all the rights and remedies of a secured party on default under the Code or any other applicable law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Grantor expressly agrees that, in any such event, Agent without demand of performance or other demand, advertisement or notice of any kind (except a notice specified below of time and place of public or private sale) to or upon any Grantor or any other Person (all and each of which demands, advertisements and notices are hereby expressly waived to the maximum extent permitted by the Code or any other applicable law), may take immediate possession of all or any portion of the Collateral and (i) require Grantors to, and each Grantor hereby agrees that it will at its own expense and upon request of Agent forthwith, assemble all or part of the Collateral as directed by Agent and make it available to Agent at one or more locations where such Grantor regularly maintains Inventory, and (ii) without notice except as specified below, sell the Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any of Agent's offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit, and upon such other terms as Agent may deem commercially reasonable. Each Grantor agrees that, to the extent notification of sale shall be required by law, at least ten days notification by mail to the applicable Grantor of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification and specifically such notification shall constitute a reasonable "authenticated notification of disposition" within the meaning of Section 9-611 of the Code. Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notification of sale having been given. Agent may adjourn any public sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. Each Grantor agrees that (A) the internet shall constitute a "place" for purposes of Section 9-610(b) of the Code, and (B) to the extent notification of sale shall be required by law, notification by mail of the URL where a sale will occur and the time when a sale will commence at least ten days prior to the sale shall constitute a reasonable notification for purposes of Section 9-611(b) of the Code. Each Grantor agrees that any sale of Collateral to a licensor pursuant to the terms of a license agreement between such licensor and a Grantor is sufficient to constitute a commercially reasonable sale (including as to method, terms, manner, and time) within the meaning of Section 9-610 of the Code. (b) Agent is hereby granted a license or other right to use, without liability for royalties or any other charge, each Grantor's Intellectual Property, including but not limited to, any labels, Patents, Trademarks, trade names, URLs, domain names, industrial designs, Copyrights, and advertising matter, whether owned by any Grantor or with respect to which any Grantor has rights under license, sublicense, or other agreements (including any Intellectual Property License), as it pertains to the Collateral, in preparing for sale, advertising for sale and selling any Collateral, and each Grantor's rights under all licenses and all franchise agreements shall inure to the benefit of Agent. (c) Agent may, in addition to other rights and remedies provided for herein, in the other Loan Documents, or otherwise available to it under applicable law and without the requirement of notice to or upon any Grantor or any other Person (which notice is hereby expressly waived to the maximum extent permitted by the Code or any other applicable law), (i) with respect to any Grantor's Deposit Accounts in which Agent's Liens are perfected by control under Section 9-104 of the Code, instruct the bank maintaining such Deposit Account for the applicable Grantor to pay the balance of such Deposit Account to or for the benefit of Agent, and (ii) with respect to any Grantor's Securities Accounts in which Agent's Liens are perfected by control under Section
  -36- 9-106 of the Code, instruct the securities intermediary maintaining such Securities Account for the applicable Grantor to (A) transfer any cash in such Securities Account to or for the benefit of Agent, or (B) liquidate any financial assets in such Securities Account that are customarily sold on a recognized market and transfer the cash proceeds thereof to or for the benefit of Agent. (d) Any cash held by Agent as Collateral and all cash proceeds received by Agent in respect of any sale of, collection from, or other realization upon all or any part of the Collateral shall be applied against the Secured Obligations in the order set forth in the Credit Agreement. In the event the proceeds of Collateral are insufficient to satisfy all of the Secured Obligations in full, each Grantor shall remain jointly and severally liable for any such deficiency. (e) Each Grantor hereby acknowledges that the Secured Obligations arise out of a commercial transaction, and agrees that if an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing Agent shall have the right to an immediate writ of possession without notice of a hearing. Agent shall have the right to the appointment of a receiver for the properties and assets of each Grantor, and each Grantor hereby consents to such rights and such appointment and hereby waives any objection such Grantor may have thereto or the right to have a bond or other security posted by Agent. 18. Remedies Cumulative. Each right, power, and remedy of Agent, any other member of the Lender Group, or any Bank Product Provider as provided for in this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or any Bank Product Agreement now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise shall be cumulative and concurrent and shall be in addition to every other right, power, or remedy provided for in this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the Bank Product Agreements or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise, and the exercise or beginning of the exercise by Agent, any other member of the Lender Group, or any Bank Product Provider, of any one or more of such rights, powers, or remedies shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise by Agent, such other member of the Lender Group or such Bank Product Provider of any or all such other rights, powers, or remedies. 19. Marshaling. Agent shall not be required to marshal any present or future collateral security (including but not limited to the Collateral) for, or other assurances of payment of, the Secured Obligations or any of them or to resort to such collateral security or other assurances of payment in any particular order, and all of its rights and remedies hereunder and in respect of such collateral security and other assurances of payment shall be cumulative and in addition to all other rights and remedies, however existing or arising. To the extent that it lawfully may, each Grantor hereby agrees that it will not invoke any law relating to the marshaling of collateral which might cause delay in or impede the enforcement of Agent's rights and remedies under this Agreement or under any other instrument creating or evidencing any of the Secured Obligations or under which any of the Secured Obligations is outstanding or by which any of the Secured Obligations is secured or payment thereof is otherwise assured, and, to the extent that it lawfully may, each Grantor hereby irrevocably waives the benefits of all such laws. 20. Indemnity. Each Grantor agrees to indemnify Agent, the other members of the Lender Group, and the Bank Product Providers from and against all claims, lawsuits and liabilities (including reasonable and documented attorneys' fees) arising out of or resulting from this Agreement (including enforcement of this Agreement) or any other Loan Document to which such
  -37- Grantor is a party, in each case, in accordance with and to the extent set forth in Section 10.3 of the Credit Agreement. This provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the Credit Agreement and the repayment of the Secured Obligations. 21. Merger, Amendments; Etc. THIS AGREEMENT, TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, REPRESENTS THE FINAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS OR ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement, and no consent to any departure by any Grantor herefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Agent, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given. No amendment of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Agent and each Grantor to which such amendment applies. 22. Addresses for Notices. All notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be given in the form and manner and delivered to Agent at its address specified in the Credit Agreement, and to any of the Grantors at the notice address specified for Loan Parties in the Credit Agreement, or as to any party, at such other address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to the other party. 23. Continuing Security Interest: Assignments under Credit Agreement. (a) This Agreement shall create a continuing security interest in the Collateral and shall (i) remain in full force and effect until the Obligations have been paid in full in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement and the Commitments have expired or have been terminated, (ii) be binding upon each Grantor, and their respective successors and assigns, and (iii) inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, Agent, and its successors, transferees and assigns. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause (iii), any Lender may, in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement, assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of its rights and obligations under the Credit Agreement to any other Person, and such other Person shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted to such Lender herein or otherwise. Upon payment in full of the Secured Obligations in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement and the expiration or termination of the Commitments, the Guaranty made and the Security Interest granted hereby shall terminate and all rights to the Collateral shall revert to Grantors or any other Person entitled thereto. At such time, upon Borrowers' request (and at the sole expense of Borrowers), Agent will authorize the filing of appropriate termination statements to terminate such Security Interest, return any Collateral then in Agent's possession and execute and deliver any documents, and take any actions, as Borrowers reasonably request to evidence the termination and release of the Agent's Liens in the Collateral. No transfer or renewal, extension, assignment, or termination of this Agreement or of the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any other instrument or document executed and delivered by any Grantor to Agent nor any additional Revolving Loans or other loans made by any Lender to any Borrower, nor the taking of further security, nor the retaking or re-delivery of the Collateral to Grantors, or any of them, by Agent, nor any other act of the Lender Group or the Bank Product Providers, or any of them, shall release any Grantor from any obligation, except a release or discharge executed in writing by Agent in accordance with the provisions of the Credit
  -38- Agreement. Agent shall not by any act, delay, omission or otherwise, be deemed to have waived any of its rights or remedies hereunder, unless such waiver is in writing and signed by Agent and then only to the extent therein set forth. A waiver by Agent of any right or remedy on any occasion shall not be construed as a bar to the exercise of any such right or remedy which Agent would otherwise have had on any other occasion. (b) If any member of the Lender Group or any Bank Product Provider repays, refunds, restores, or returns in whole or in part, any payment or property (including any proceeds of Collateral) previously paid or transferred to such member of the Lender Group or such Bank Product Provider in full or partial satisfaction of any Secured Obligation or on account of any other obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document or any Bank Product Agreement, because the payment, transfer, or the incurrence of the obligation so satisfied is asserted or declared to be void, voidable, or otherwise recoverable under any law relating to creditors' rights, including provisions of the Bankruptcy Code relating to fraudulent transfers, preferences, or other voidable or recoverable obligations or transfers (each, a "Voidable Transfer"), or because such member of the Lender Group or Bank Product Provider elects to do so on the reasonable advice of its counsel in connection with a claim that the payment, transfer, or incurrence is or may be a Voidable Transfer, then, as to any such Voidable Transfer, or the amount thereof that such member of the Lender Group or Bank Product Provider elects to repay, restore, or return (including pursuant to a settlement of any claim in respect thereof), and as to all reasonable and documented costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees of such member of the Lender Group or Bank Product Provider related thereto, (i) the liability of the Loan Parties with respect to the amount or property paid, refunded, restored, or returned will automatically and immediately be revived, reinstated, and restored and will exist, and (ii) Agent's Liens securing such liability shall be effective, revived, and remain in full force and effect, in each case, as fully as if such Voidable Transfer had never been made. If, prior to any of the foregoing, (A) Agent's Liens shall have been released or terminated, or (B) any provision of this Agreement shall have been terminated or cancelled, Agent's Liens, or such provision of this Agreement, shall be reinstated in full force and effect and such prior release, termination, cancellation or surrender shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligation of any Loan Party in respect of such liability or any Collateral securing such liability. (c) In connection with any Disposition of Collateral permitted pursuant to Section 6.4 of the Credit Agreement, Agent hereby acknowledges and agrees in accordance with Section 15.11(a) of the Credit Agreement to promptly release Agent's Lien in such Collateral and to promptly execute and deliver, upon the applicable Grantor's reasonable written request therefor (and at the sole expense of such Grantor), such documents, releases or other evidence of termination of the Agent's Lien in such Collateral. 24. Survival. All representations and warranties made by the Grantors in this Agreement and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that Agent, Issuing Lender, or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or Event of Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended under the Credit Agreement, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the
  -39- principal of or any accrued interest on any loan or any fee or any other amount payable under the Credit Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. 25. CHOICE OF LAW AND VENUE; JURY TRIAL WAIVER; JUDICIAL REFERENCE PROVISION. (a) THE VALIDITY OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE CONSTRUCTION, INTERPRETATION, AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF, THE RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES HERETO WITH RESPECT TO ALL MATTERS ARISING HEREUNDER OR RELATED HERETO, AND ANY CLAIMS, CONTROVERSIES OR DISPUTES ARISING HEREUNDER OR RELATED HERETO SHALL BE DETERMINED UNDER, GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

EACH GRANTOR AND AGENT WAIVE, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT EACH MAY HAVE TO ASSERT THE DOCTRINE OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS OR TO OBJECT TO VENUE TO THE EXTENT ANY PROCEEDING IS BROUGHT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS SECTION 25(b). (c) TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH GRANTOR AND AGENT HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS, IF ANY, TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM, CONTROVERSY, DISPUTE OR CAUSE OF ACTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN, INCLUDING CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, BREACH OF DUTY CLAIMS, AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW OR STATUTORY CLAIMS (EACH A "CLAIM"). EACH GRANTOR AND AGENT REPRESENT THAT EACH HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER AND EACH KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE FILED AS A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT. (d) EACH GRANTOR HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN THE COUNTY OF NEW YORK AND THE STATE OF NEW YORK, IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR FOR RECOGNITION OR ENFORCEMENT OF ANY JUDGMENT. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO AGREES THAT A FINAL JUDGMENT IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR IN ANY
  -40- OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY LAW. NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL AFFECT ANY RIGHT THAT AGENT MAY OTHERWISE HAVE TO BRING ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AGAINST ANY GRANTOR OR ITS PROPERTIES IN THE COURTS OF ANY JURISDICTION. (e) NO CLAIM MAY BE MADE BY ANY GRANTOR, ON THE ONE HAND, OR ANY MEMBER OF THE LENDER GROUP, ON THE OTHER, AGAINST EACH OTHER, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, COUNSELS, REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS, OR ATTORNEYS-IN-FACT FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN RESPECT OF ANY CLAIM FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT OR ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, OR ANY ACT, OMISSION, OR EVENT OCCURRING IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, AND EACH SUCH PERSON HEREBY WAIVES, RELEASES, AND AGREES NOT TO SUE UPON ANY CLAIM FOR SUCH DAMAGES, WHETHER OR NOT ACCRUED AND WHETHER OR NOT KNOWN OR SUSPECTED TO EXIST IN ITS FAVOR. (f) IN THE EVENT ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING IS FILED IN A COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA (THE "COURT") BY OR AGAINST ANY PARTY HERETO IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CLAIM AND THE WAIVER SET FORTH IN SECTION 25(c) ABOVE IS NOT ENFORCEABLE IN SUCH PROCEEDING, THE PARTIES HERETO AGREE AS FOLLOWS: (i) WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE MATTERS SPECIFIED IN SUBCLAUSE (ii) BELOW, ANY CLAIM SHALL BE DETERMINED BY A GENERAL REFERENCE PROCEEDING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF CALIFORNIA CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTIONS 638 THROUGH 645.1. THE PARTIES INTEND THIS GENERAL REFERENCE AGREEMENT TO BE SPECIFICALLY ENFORCEABLE. VENUE FOR THE REFERENCE PROCEEDING SHALL BE IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA.

THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT LIMIT THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO EXERCISE OR OPPOSE ANY OF THE RIGHTS AND REMEDIES DESCRIBED IN CLAUSES (A) THROUGH (D) AND ANY SUCH EXERCISE OR OPPOSITION DOES NOT WAIVE THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO PARTICIPATE IN A REFERENCE PROCEEDING PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO ANY OTHER MATTER. (iii) UPON THE WRITTEN REQUEST OF ANY PARTY, THE PARTIES SHALL SELECT A SINGLE REFEREE, WHO SHALL BE A RETIRED JUDGE OR
  -41- JUSTICE. IF THE PARTIES DO NOT AGREE UPON A REFEREE WITHIN TEN DAYS OF SUCH WRITTEN REQUEST, THEN, ANY PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO REQUEST THE COURT TO APPOINT A REFEREE PURSUANT TO CALIFORNIA CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION 640(B). THE REFEREE SHALL BE APPOINTED TO SIT WITH ALL OF THE POWERS PROVIDED BY LAW. PENDING APPOINTMENT OF THE REFEREE, THE COURT SHALL HAVE THE POWER TO ISSUE TEMPORARY OR PROVISIONAL REMEDIES. (iv) EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE REFEREE SHALL DETERMINE THE MANNER IN WHICH THE REFERENCE PROCEEDING IS CONDUCTED INCLUDING THE TIME AND PLACE OF HEARINGS, THE ORDER OF PRESENTATION OF EVIDENCE, AND ALL OTHER QUESTIONS THAT ARISE WITH RESPECT TO THE COURSE OF THE REFERENCE PROCEEDING. ALL PROCEEDINGS AND HEARINGS CONDUCTED BEFORE THE REFEREE, EXCEPT FOR TRIAL, SHALL BE CONDUCTED WITHOUT A COURT REPORTER, EXCEPT WHEN ANY PARTY SO REQUESTS A COURT REPORTER AND A TRANSCRIPT IS ORDERED, A COURT REPORTER SHALL BE USED AND THE REFEREE SHALL BE PROVIDED A COURTESY COPY OF THE TRANSCRIPT. THE PARTY MAKING SUCH REQUEST SHALL HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO ARRANGE FOR AND PAY THE COSTS OF THE COURT REPORTER; PROVIDED, THAT SUCH COSTS, ALONG WITH THE REFEREE'S FEES, SHALL ULTIMATELY BE BORNE BY THE PARTY WHO DOES NOT PREVAIL, AS DETERMINED BY THE REFEREE. (v) THE REFEREE MAY REQUIRE ONE OR MORE PREHEARING CONFERENCES.

THE REFEREE SHALL BE EMPOWERED TO ENTER EQUITABLE AS WELL AS LEGAL RELIEF AND RULE ON ANY MOTION WHICH WOULD BE AUTHORIZED IN A TRIAL, INCLUDING MOTIONS FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT OR SUMMARY JUDGMENT. THE REFEREE SHALL REPORT HIS OR HER DECISION, WHICH REPORT SHALL ALSO INCLUDE FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW. THE REFEREE SHALL ISSUE A DECISION AND PURSUANT TO CALIFORNIA CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE, SECTION 644, THE REFEREE'S DECISION SHALL BE ENTERED BY THE COURT AS A JUDGMENT IN THE SAME MANNER AS IF THE ACTION HAD BEEN TRIED BY THE COURT. THE FINAL JUDGMENT OR ORDER FROM ANY APPEALABLE DECISION OR ORDER ENTERED BY THE REFEREE SHALL BE FULLY APPEALABLE AS IF IT HAS BEEN ENTERED BY THE COURT. (vii) THE PARTIES RECOGNIZE AND AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS RESOLVED IN A GENERAL REFERENCE PROCEEDING PURSUANT HERETO WILL BE
  -42- DECIDED BY A REFEREE AND NOT BY A JURY. AFTER CONSULTING (OR HAVING HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT) WITH COUNSEL OF THEIR OWN CHOICE, EACH PARTY HERETO KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY AND FOR THEIR MUTUAL BENEFIT AGREES THAT THIS REFERENCE PROVISION SHALL APPLY TO ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN THEM THAT ARISES OUT OF OR IS RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT. 26. New Subsidiaries. Pursuant to Section 5.11 of the Credit Agreement, certain Subsidiaries (whether by acquisition or creation) of any Grantor are required to enter into this Agreement by executing and delivering in favor of Agent a Joinder to this Agreement in substantially the form of Annex 1. Upon the execution and delivery of Annex 1 by any such new Subsidiary, such Subsidiary shall become a Guarantor and/or Grantor hereunder with the same force and effect as if originally named as a Guarantor and/or Grantor herein. The execution and delivery of any instrument adding an additional Guarantor or Grantor as a party to this Agreement shall not require the consent of any Guarantor or Grantor hereunder. The rights and obligations of each Guarantor and Grantor hereunder shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the addition of any new Guarantor or Grantor hereunder. 27. Agent. Each reference herein to any right granted to, benefit conferred upon or power exercisable by the "Agent" shall be a reference to Agent, for the benefit of each member of the Lender Group and each of the Bank Product Providers. 28. Miscellaneous. (a) This Agreement is a Loan Document. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties on separate counterparts, each of which, when executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be an original, and all of which, when taken together, shall constitute but one and the same Agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Agreement by telefacsimile or other electronic method of transmission shall be equally as effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart of this Agreement. Any party delivering an executed counterpart of this Agreement by telefacsimile or other electronic method of transmission also shall deliver an original executed counterpart of this Agreement but the failure to deliver an original executed counterpart shall not affect the validity, enforceability, and binding effect of this Agreement. The foregoing shall apply to each other Loan Document mutatis mutandis. (b) Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof in that jurisdiction or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. Each provision of this Agreement shall be severable from every other provision of this Agreement for the purpose of determining the legal enforceability of any specific provision. (c) Headings and numbers have been set forth herein for convenience only. Unless the contrary is compelled by the context, everything contained in each Section applies equally to this entire Agreement.
  -43- (d) Neither this Agreement nor any uncertainty or ambiguity herein shall be construed against any member of the Lender Group, any Bank Product Provider, or any Grantor, whether under any rule of construction or otherwise. This Agreement has been reviewed by all parties and shall be construed and interpreted according to the ordinary meaning of the words used so as to accomplish fairly the purposes and intentions of all parties hereto. 29. Intercreditor Agreement. (a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event of any conflict between any provision in this Agreement and any provision in the Intercreditor Agreement, such provision in the Intercreditor Agreement shall control. (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any obligation of any Grantor hereunder with respect to the delivery or control of any Collateral that constitutes Term Priority Collateral shall be deemed to be satisfied if such Grantor delivers or provides control of such Term Loan Priority Collateral to the Term Loan Agent in accordance with the requirements of the corresponding provision of the applicable Term Loan Document. Any representation, warranty, covenant or other obligation of any Grantor hereunder to create a "first priority" security interest in any Collateral that constitutes Term Priority Collateral shall be first priority other than any Lien in favor of the Term Loan Agent.
