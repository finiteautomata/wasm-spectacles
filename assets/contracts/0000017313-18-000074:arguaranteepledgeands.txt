  3.02 Obligations Unconditional. The obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors under Section 3.01 are irrevocable, absolute and unconditional, joint and several, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement, the other Debt Documents or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, or any substitution, release or exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations, and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor (other than the satisfaction in full of the Guaranteed Obligations), it being the intent of this Section 3 that the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that the occurrence of any one or more of the following shall not alter or impair the liability of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder, which shall remain absolute and unconditional as described above: (a) at any time or from time to time, without notice to the Subsidiary Guarantors, the time for any performance of or compliance with any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or compliance shall be waived; (b) any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of this Agreement, the other Debt Documents or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein shall be done or omitted; (c) the maturity of any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be accelerated, or any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be modified, supplemented or amended in any respect, or any right under this Agreement, the other Debt Documents or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein shall be waived or any other guarantee of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security therefor shall be released or exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with; or (d) any Lien or security interest granted to, or in favor of, any Secured Party as security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall fail to be perfected.

The obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors under this Section 3 shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower in respect of the Guaranteed 522144.000028 21651939.2 25323438.4.BUSINESS
  Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise, and the Subsidiary Guarantors jointly and severally agree that they will indemnify the Secured Parties on demand for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented fees and other charges of counsel (but excluding the allocated costs of internal counsel)) incurred by the Secured Parties in connection with such rescission or restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law. 3.04 Subrogation.

The Subsidiary Guarantors jointly and severally agree that, as between the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Secured Parties, a Guaranteed Obligation may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in the respective Debt Document therefor including, in the case of the Revolving Credit Agreement, the provisions specifying the existence of an event of default (and shall be deemed to have become automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided therein including, in the case of the Revolving Credit Agreement, such provisions) for purposes of Section 3.01 notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such declaration (or such obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantors and that, in the event of such declaration (or such obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and payable), such obligations (whether or not due and payable by the Borrower) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Subsidiary Guarantors for purposes of Section 3.01. 3.06 Continuing Guarantee.

  (as defined below) by reason of the payment by such Subsidiary Guarantor of any Guaranteed Obligations, then each other Subsidiary Guarantor shall, on demand of such Excess Funding Guarantor (but subject to the next sentence), pay to such Excess Funding Guarantor an amount equal to such Subsidiary Guarantor’s Pro Rata Share (as defined below and determined, for this purpose, without reference to the properties, debts and liabilities of such Excess Funding Guarantor) of the Excess Payment (as defined below) in respect of such Guaranteed Obligations. The payment obligation of a Subsidiary Guarantor to any Excess Funding Guarantor under this Section 3.08 shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under the other provisions of this Section 3 and such Excess Funding Guarantor shall not exercise any right or remedy with respect to such excess until payment and satisfaction in full of all of such obligations. For purposes of this Section 3.08, (i) “Excess Funding Guarantor” means, in respect of any Guaranteed Obligations, a Subsidiary Guarantor that has paid an amount in excess of its Pro Rata Share of such Guaranteed Obligations, (ii) “Excess Payment” means, in respect of any Guaranteed Obligations, the amount paid by an Excess Funding Guarantor in excess of its Pro Rata Share of such Guaranteed Obligations and (iii) “Pro Rata Share” means, for any Subsidiary Guarantor, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of (x) the amount by which the aggregate fair saleable value of all properties of such Subsidiary Guarantor (excluding any shares of stock or other equity interest of any other Subsidiary Guarantor) exceeds the amount of all the debts and liabilities of such Subsidiary Guarantor (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder and any obligations of any other Subsidiary Guarantor that have been Guaranteed by such Subsidiary Guarantor) to (y) the amount by which the aggregate fair saleable value of all properties of the Borrower and all of the Subsidiary Guarantors exceeds the amount of all the debts and liabilities (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of the Obligors hereunder) of the Borrower and all of the Subsidiary Guarantors, determined (A) with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a party hereto on the date hereof, as of the date hereof, and (B) with respect to any other Subsidiary Guarantor, as of the date such Subsidiary Guarantor becomes a Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder. 3.09 General Limitation on Guarantee Obligations. In any action or proceeding involving any state corporate or other law, or any Federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the obligations of any Subsidiary Guarantor under Section 3.01 would otherwise, taking into account the provisions of Section 3.08, be held or determined to be void, invalid or unenforceable, or subordinated to the claims of any other creditors, on account of the amount of its liability under Section 3.01, then, notwithstanding any other provision hereof to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by such Subsidiary Guarantor, any Secured Party or any other Person, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and enforceable and not subordinated to the claims of other creditors as determined in such action or proceeding. 522144.000028 21651939.2 25323438.4.BUSINESS
  3.10 Indemnity by Borrower.

Each Qualified ECP Guarantor hereby jointly and severally absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support as may be needed from time to time by each other Obligor to honor all of its obligations under the guarantee contained in this Section 3 in respect of Swap Obligations (provided, however that each Qualified ECP Guarantor shall only be liable under this Section 3.11 for the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations under this Section 3.11, or otherwise under the guarantee contained in this Section 3, as it relates to such other Obligor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount). The obligations of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section 3.11 shall remain in full force and effect until payment in full of all the Secured Obligations (other than in respect of indemnities and contingent Obligations not then due and payable).

  or property at any time payable or receivable on account of or in exchange for any of the Collateral, but shall be under no obligation to do so; and (e) the Collateral Agent may, upon reasonable prior notice (provided that at least ten (10) Business Days’ prior notice shall be deemed to be reasonable) to the Obligors of the time and place (or, if such sale is to take place on the NYSE or any other established exchange or market, prior to the time of such sale or other disposition), with respect to the Collateral or any part thereof which shall then be or shall thereafter come into the possession, custody or control of the Collateral Agent, the other Secured Parties or any of their respective agents, sell, assign or otherwise dispose of all or any part of such Collateral, at such place or places as the Collateral Agent deems appropriate, and for cash or for credit or for future delivery (without thereby assuming any credit risk), at public or private sale, without demand of performance or notice of intention to effect any such disposition or of the time or place thereof (except such notice as is required above or by applicable statute and cannot be waived), and the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party or anyone else may be the purchaser, assignee or recipient of any or all of the Collateral so disposed of at any public sale (or, to the extent permitted by law, at any private sale) and thereafter, to the fullest extent permitted by law, hold the same absolutely, free from any claim or right of whatsoever kind, including any right or equity of redemption (statutory or otherwise), of the Obligors, any such demand, notice and right or equity being hereby expressly waived and released, to the fullest extent permitted by law. The Collateral Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for the sale, and such sale may be made at any time or place to which the sale may be so adjourned. The proceeds of each collection, sale or other disposition under this Section 8.03 shall be applied in accordance with Section 8.06. The Obligors recognize that, by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and applicable state securities laws, the Collateral Agent may be compelled, with respect to any sale of all or any part of the Collateral, to limit purchasers to those who will agree, among other things, to acquire the Collateral for their own account, for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. The Obligors acknowledge that any such private sales may be at prices and on terms less favorable to the Collateral Agent than those obtainable through a public sale without such restrictions, and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agree that to the extent any such private sale is conducted by the Collateral Agent in a commercially reasonable manner, the Collateral Agent shall have no obligation to engage in public sales and no obligation to delay the sale of any Collateral for the period of time necessary to permit the Obligors, or the issuer thereof, to register it for public sale. 8.04 Deficiency. If the proceeds of sale, collection or other realization of or upon the Collateral pursuant to Section 8.03 are insufficient to cover the costs and 522144.000028 21651939.2 25323438.4.BUSINESS
  expenses of such realization and the payment in full of the Secured Obligations, the Obligors shall remain liable for any such deficiency. 8.05 Private Sale. The Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties shall incur no liability as a result of the sale of the Collateral, or any part thereof, at any private sale pursuant to Section 8.03 conducted in a commercially reasonable manner. Each Obligor hereby waives any claims against the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party arising by reason of the fact that the price at which the Collateral may have been sold at such a private sale was less than the price which might have been obtained at a public sale or was less than the aggregate amount of the Secured Obligations, even if the Collateral Agent accepts the first offer received and does not offer the Collateral to more than one offeree, so long as such private sale was conducted in a commercially reasonable manner. 8.06 Application of Proceeds. Except as otherwise herein expressly provided, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default or a Trigger Event and pursuant to the exercise of any remedies under this Section 8, the proceeds of any collection, sale or other realization of all or any part of the Collateral of any Obligor (including any other cash of any Obligor at the time held by the Collateral Agent under this Agreement) shall be applied by the Collateral Agent as follows: First, to the payment of costs and expenses of such collection, sale or other realization, including reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Collateral Agent and the reasonable fees and expenses of its agents and counsel, and all expenses incurred and advances made by the Collateral Agent in connection therewith; Second, to the payment of any fees and other amounts then owing by such Obligor to (x) the Collateral Agent in its capacity as such, (y) the Revolving Administrative Agent in its capacity as such and (z) any Financing Agent in its capacity as such (in the case of clauses (x), (y) and (z), ratably based on the aggregate amount of such fees and other amounts); Third, to the payment of the Secured Obligations of such Obligor then due and payable, in each case to each Secured Party ratably in accordance with the amount of Secured Obligations then due and payable to such Secured Party (it being understood that, for the purposes hereof, the outstanding principal amount of the Loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement shall be deemed then due and payable whether or not any Acceleration of such loans has occurred); and Fourth, after application as provided in clauses “First”, “Second”, and “Third” above, to the payment to the respective Obligor, or their respective successors or assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct, of any surplus then remaining. For the avoidance of doubt, payments made pursuant to Section 2.08(b), (c) or (d) of the Revolving Credit Agreement (or any analogous provisions in any amendment, 522144.000028 21651939.2 25323438.4.BUSINESS
  modification, supplement, amendment, restatement, extension, refinancing or replacement thereof) shall not be subject to this Section 8.06 or to Section 5.02, unless the Collateral Agent, after the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default, has directed the actions giving rise to such payments. In making the allocations required by this Section 8, the Collateral Agent may rely upon its records and information supplied to it pursuant to Section 9.02, and the Collateral Agent shall have no liability to any of the other Secured Parties for actions taken in reliance on such information, except to the extent of its gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. The Collateral Agent may, in its sole discretion, at the time of any application under this Section 8, withhold all or any portion of the proceeds otherwise to be applied to the Secured Obligations as provided above and maintain the same in a segregated cash collateral account in the name and under the exclusive NYUCC Control of the Collateral Agent, to the extent that it in good faith believes that the information provided to it pursuant to Section 9.02 is either incomplete or inaccurate and that application of the full amount of such proceeds to the Secured Obligations would be disadvantageous to any Secured Party. All distributions made by the Collateral Agent pursuant to this Section 8 shall be final (subject to any decree of any court of competent jurisdiction), and the Collateral Agent shall have no duty to inquire as to the application by the other Secured Parties of any amounts distributed to them. Excluded Swap Obligations with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantor shall not be paid with amounts received from such Subsidiary Guarantor or its assets, but appropriate adjustments shall be made with respect to payments from other Obligors to preserve the allocation to Secured Obligations otherwise set forth above in this Section 8.06. 8.07 Attorney-in-Fact. Without limiting any rights or powers granted by this Agreement to the Collateral Agent while no Event of Default or Trigger Event has occurred and is continuing, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default or Trigger Event, the Collateral Agent is hereby appointed the attorney-in-fact of each Obligor for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Section 8 and taking any action and executing any instruments which the Collateral Agent may reasonably deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes hereof, which appointment as attorney-in-fact is irrevocable and coupled with an interest. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, so long as the Collateral Agent shall be entitled under this Section 8 to make collections in respect of the Collateral, the Collateral Agent shall have the right and power to receive, endorse and collect all checks made payable to the order of any Obligor representing any dividend, payment or other distribution in respect of the Collateral or any part thereof and to give full discharge for the same. 8.08 Intellectual Property. For the purpose of enabling the Collateral Agent, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default or a Trigger Event, to exercise rights and remedies hereunder at such time as the Collateral Agent shall be lawfully entitled to exercise such rights and remedies, each Obligor hereby grants to the Collateral Agent, if and only to the extent of such Obligor’s rights to grant the same, an irrevocable, non-exclusive license to use, assign, license or sublicense any 522144.000028 21651939.2 25323438.4.BUSINESS
  of the Intellectual Property Collateral (other than any Excluded Assets) now owned or hereafter acquired by such Obligor (exercisable without payment of royalty or other compensation to such Obligor). Such license shall include access to all media in which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all computer programs used for the compilation or printout thereof. If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, upon the written demand of the Collateral Agent, each Obligor shall execute and deliver to the Collateral Agent an assignment or assignments of any registered Patents, Trademarks (including goodwill) and/or Copyrights and such other documents as are necessary or appropriate to carry out the intent and purposes hereof. Section 9. The Collateral Agent. 9.01 Appointment; Powers and Immunities. Each Revolving Lender, the Revolving Administrative Agent, each Financing Agent and, by acceptance of the benefits of this Agreement and the other Security Documents, each Designated Indebtedness Holder hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes ING to act as the collateral agent hereunder and authorizes ING to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Collateral Agent by the terms of this Agreement, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is understood that such powers authorize the Collateral Agent to enter into the agreements and the other documents contemplated by Section 5.08(c) of the Revolving Credit Agreement on behalf of itself and the other Secured Parties hereunder. The Collateral Agent (which term as used in this sentence and in Section 9.06 and the first sentence of Section 9.07 shall include reference to its Affiliates and its own and its Affiliates’ officers, directors, employees and agents): (a) shall have no duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and shall not by reason of this Agreement be a trustee for, a fiduciary with respect to or subject to any other implied duties with respect to, the Revolving Administrative Agent, any Revolving Lender, any Financing Agent or any Designated Indebtedness Holder regardless of whether a Default or Trigger Event has occurred and is continuing; (b) shall not be responsible to the Revolving Lenders, the Revolving Administrative Agent, the Financing Agents or the Designated Indebtedness Holders for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into any recitals, statements, representations or warranties contained in or made in connection with this Agreement or in any notice delivered hereunder, or in any other certificate, report or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by it under, this Agreement, or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document referred to or provided for herein or therein or for any failure by the Obligors or any other Person to perform or observe any of its obligations hereunder; (c) shall not be required to initiate or conduct any litigation or collection proceedings hereunder except, subject to Section 9.07, for any such 522144.000028 21651939.2 25323438.4.BUSINESS
  litigation or proceedings relating to the enforcement of the guarantee set forth in Section 3, or the Liens created pursuant to Section 4; and (d) shall not be responsible for any action taken or not taken by it hereunder or under any other document or instrument referred to or provided for herein or therein or in connection herewith or therewith, except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. 9.02 Information Regarding Secured Parties. The Borrower will at such times and from time to time as shall be reasonably requested by the Collateral Agent supply a list in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent setting forth the amount of the Secured Obligations held by each Secured Party (excluding, so long as ING is both the Collateral Agent and the Revolving Administrative Agent, the Revolving Credit Agreement Obligations) as at a date specified in such request. The Collateral Agent shall provide any such list to any Secured Party upon request. The Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, such information, and such information shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes of this Agreement, except to the extent the Collateral Agent shall have been notified by a Secured Party in writing that such information as set forth on any such list is inaccurate or in dispute between such Secured Party and the Borrower. 9.03 Reliance by Collateral Agent. The Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other communication (including any thereof by telephone, telecopy, telex, telegram, cable or electronic mail) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts selected by the Collateral Agent. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder or thereunder in accordance with instructions given by (i) the Required Secured Parties or (ii) where expressly permitted for in Section 10.03, the Required Revolving Lenders and the Required Designated Indebtedness Holders, as applicable, and such instructions of the (i) Required Secured Parties or (ii) where expressly permitted for in Section 10.03, the Required Revolving Lenders and the Required Designated Indebtedness Holders, as applicable, and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Secured Parties. If in one or more instances the Collateral Agent takes any action or assumes any responsibility not specifically delegated to it pursuant to this Agreement, neither the taking of such action nor the assumption of such responsibility shall be deemed to be an express or implied undertaking on the part of the Collateral Agent that it will take the same or similar action or assume the same or similar responsibility in any other instance. 9.04 Rights as a Secured Party. With respect to its obligation to extend credit under the Revolving Credit Agreement, ING (and any successor acting as Collateral Agent) in its capacity as a Revolving Lender under the Revolving Credit 522144.000028 21651939.2 25323438.4.BUSINESS
  Agreement shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Secured Party and may exercise the same as though it were not acting as Collateral Agent, and the term “Secured Party” or “Secured Parties” shall, unless the context otherwise indicates, include the Collateral Agent in its individual capacity. ING (and any successor acting as Collateral Agent) and its Affiliates may (without having to account therefor to any other Secured Party) accept deposits from, lend money to, make investments in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with any of the Obligors (and any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates) as if it were not acting as Collateral Agent, and ING and its Affiliates may accept fees and other consideration from any of the Obligors for services in connection with this Agreement or otherwise without having to account for the same to the other Secured Parties. 9.05 Indemnification. Each Revolving Lender, the Revolving Administrative Agent (but only to the extent the Revolving Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent are not the same Person), each Financing Agent and, by acceptance of the benefits of this Agreement and the other Security Documents, each Designated Indebtedness Holder, severally agrees to indemnify the Collateral Agent and each Related Party of the Collateral Agent (each such Person being called an “Indemnitee”) (to the extent not reimbursed under Section 10.04, but without limiting the obligations of the Obligors under Section 10.04) ratably in accordance with the aggregate Secured Obligations held by the Revolving Lenders and the Designated Indebtedness Holders, for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, claims, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee (including by any other Secured Party) arising out of, in connection with, or by reason of any actual or probable claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding, whether based in contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto, in connection with or in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any other Debt Documents, or any other documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including the costs and expenses that the Obligors are obligated to pay under Section 10.04, but excluding, unless an Event of Default or a Trigger Event has occurred and is continuing, normal administrative costs and expenses incident to the performance of its agency duties hereunder) or the enforcement of any of the terms hereof or thereof or of any such other documents; provided, that such indemnity shall not as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such liabilities, obligations, losses, claims, damages, penalties or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. 9.06 Non-Reliance on Collateral Agent and Other Secured Parties. The Revolving Administrative Agent and each Financing Agent (and each Revolving Lender and each Designated Indebtedness Holder by acceptance of the benefits of this Agreement and the other Security Documents) agrees that it has, independently and without reliance on the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of the Borrower, the Subsidiary Guarantors and their Subsidiaries and decision to extend 522144.000028 21651939.2 25323438.4.BUSINESS
  credit to the Borrower in reliance on this Agreement and that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own analysis and decisions in taking or not taking action under or based on this Agreement and any Debt Document to which it is a party. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Collateral Agent shall not be required to keep itself informed as to the performance or observance by any Obligor of this Agreement, any other Debt Document or any other document referred to or provided for herein or therein or to inspect the properties or books of any Obligor. The Collateral Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to disclose, and shall not be liable for failure to disclose, any information relating to any Obligor or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of their Affiliates) that may come into the possession of the Collateral Agent or any of its Affiliates, except for notices, reports and other documents and information expressly required to be furnished to the other Secured Parties by the Collateral Agent hereunder. 9.07 Failure to Act. Except for action expressly required of the Collateral Agent hereunder, the Collateral Agent shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder unless it shall receive further assurances to its satisfaction from the other Secured Parties of their indemnification obligations under Section 9.05 against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Collateral Agent shall not be required to take any action that in the judgment of the Collateral Agent would violate any applicable law. 9.08 Resignation of Collateral Agent. Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Collateral Agent as provided below, the Collateral Agent may resign at any time by notifying the other Secured Parties and the Obligors. Upon any such resignation, the Required Secured Parties shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed provided that no such consent shall be required if an Event of Default or a Trigger Event has occurred and is continuing to appoint a successor Collateral Agent. If no successor Collateral Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Secured Parties and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Collateral Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Collateral Agent may, on behalf of the other Secured Parties, appoint a successor Collateral Agent, that shall be a financial institution that has an office in New York, New York and has a combined capital and surplus and undivided profits of at least $1,000,000,000. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Collateral Agent hereunder by a successor Collateral Agent, such successor Collateral Agent shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Collateral Agent, and the retiring Collateral Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any retiring Collateral Agent’s resignation hereunder as Collateral Agent, the provisions of this Section 9 and Section 10.04 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Collateral Agent. The Borrower shall pay to any successor Collateral Agent the fees and charges necessary to induce such successor Collateral 522144.000028 21651939.2 25323438.4.BUSINESS
  Agent to accept its appointment hereunder, such payment to be made as and when invoiced by the successor Collateral Agent. 9.09 Agents and Attorneys-in-Fact.

Section 10. Miscellaneous. 10.01 Notices. All notices, requests, consents and other demands hereunder and other communications provided for herein shall be given or made in writing, (a) to any party hereto, telecopied (to the extent provided in the Revolving Credit Agreement), emailed or delivered to the intended recipient at the “Address for Notices” specified below its name on the signature pages to this Agreement or, in the case of any Financing Agent or Designated Indebtedness Holder that shall become a party hereto after the date hereof, at such “Address for Notices” as shall be specified pursuant to or in connection with the joinder agreement executed and delivered by such Financing Agent or Designated Indebtedness Holder pursuant to Section 6.01 (provided that notices to any Subsidiary Guarantor shall be given to such Subsidiary Guarantor care of the Borrower at the address for the Borrower specified herein) or (b) as to any party, at such other address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to each other party. All notices to any Revolving Lender or Designated Indebtedness Holder that is not a party hereto shall be given to the Revolving Administrative Agent for such Revolving Lender or the Financing Agent for such Designated Indebtedness Holder (or, if there is no Financing Agent, to each Designated Indebtedness Holder). 10.02 No Waiver. No failure on the part of the Collateral Agent or any Secured Party to exercise, and no course of dealing with respect to, and no delay in exercising any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Collateral Agent or any Secured Party of any right, power or remedy, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right, power or remedy, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. The rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Obligors therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by Section 10.03, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. 10.03 Amendments to Security Documents, Etc. Except as otherwise provided in any Security Document, the terms of this Agreement and the other Security Documents may be waived, altered, amended or modified only by an agreement or agreements in writing duly executed and entered into by each Obligor and the Collateral Agent, with the consent of the Required Secured Parties, the Required Revolving Lenders and the Required Designated Indebtedness Holders; provided that: 522144.000028 21651939.2 25323438.4.BUSINESS

Any such amendment or waiver shall be binding upon the Collateral Agent, each Secured Party and each Obligor.

Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, if the Termination Date shall have occurred with respect to any Class, then the consent rights of such Class (and the related Required Revolving Lenders or Required Designated Indebtedness Holders) under this Section 10.03 shall terminate. 10.04 Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) Costs and Expenses. The Obligors hereby jointly and severally agree to reimburse the Collateral Agent and each of the other Secured Parties and their respective Affiliates for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses incurred by them (including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of one outside counsel and of any necessary special and/or local counsel for the Collateral Agent (other than the allocated costs of internal counsel)) in connection with (i) any Event of Default or Trigger Event and any enforcement or collection proceeding resulting therefrom, including all manner of participation in or other involvement with (w) performance by the Collateral Agent of any obligations of the Obligors in respect of the Collateral that the Obligors have failed or refused to perform in the time period required under this Agreement, (x) bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, foreclosure, winding up or liquidation proceedings of any Obligor, or any actual or attempted sale, or any exchange, enforcement, collection, compromise or settlement in respect of any of the Collateral, and for the care of the Collateral and defending or asserting rights and claims of the Collateral Agent in respect thereof, by litigation or otherwise, including expenses of insurance, (y) judicial or regulatory proceedings arising from or related to this Agreement and (z) workout, restructuring or other negotiations or proceedings (whether or not the workout, restructuring or transaction contemplated thereby is consummated) and (ii) the enforcement of this Section 10.04, and all such costs and expenses shall be 522144.000028 21651939.2 25323438.4.BUSINESS
