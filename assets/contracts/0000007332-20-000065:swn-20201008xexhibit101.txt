(a)    the representations and warranties set forth in Article III of the Credit Agreement and in the other Loan Documents are true and correct in all material respects (or, in the case of any such representations and warranties that are qualified as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect in the text thereof, such representations and warranties are true and correct in all respects) on and as of the Amendment No. 8 Effective Date, except to the extent made as of a specific date, which representations and warranties shall have been true and correct in all material respects as of such specific date (or, in the case of any such representation and warranties that are qualified as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect in the text thereof, such representations and warranties shall have been true and correct in all respects as of such specific date); and

(b)    no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the Amendment No. 8 Effective Date.

Section 11.    Issuing Bank Agreement. Pursuant to Section 2.04(k) of the Credit Agreement, the Borrower hereby provides notice to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders of its designation of Bank of Montreal, Truist Bank and PNC Bank, National Association (each, an “Additional Issuing Bank” and collectively, the “Additional Issuing Banks”) as additional Issuing Banks, and that each Additional Issuing Bank has accepted such appointment. The Additional Issuing Banks, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent agree that this Amendment shall constitute an Issuing Bank Agreement as described in Section 2.04(k) of the Credit Agreement, to be effective as of the Montage Merger Effective Date. Accordingly, from and after the Montage Merger Effective Date, (a) each Additional Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (b) references in the Credit Agreement and in the other Loan Documents to the term “Issuing Bank” shall be deemed to include each Additional Issuing Bank in its capacity as an Issuing Bank, and (c) the LC Issuance Limits of each Additional Issuing Bank are as forth on Schedule 1.01B of the Credit Agreement, as amended by this Amendment.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except pursuant hereto or as expressly contemplated or amended hereby, nothing contained herein shall be deemed: (a) to constitute a waiver of compliance or consent to noncompliance by any Loan Party with respect to any term, provision, condition or covenant of


the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document; (b) to prejudice any right or remedy that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may now have or may have in the future under or in connection with the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document; or (c) to constitute a waiver of compliance or consent to noncompliance by the Borrower with respect to the terms, provisions, conditions and covenants of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents made the subject hereof.

Section 13.    Ratification of Collateral Documents. The Borrower hereby acknowledges and ratifies, on behalf of itself and each other Loan Party, the existence and priority of the Liens granted by the Loan Parties in and to the Collateral in favor of the Secured Parties and represents and warrants, on behalf of itself and each other Loan Party, that such Liens and security interests are valid, existing and in full force and effect. The Borrower hereby ratifies and confirms, on behalf of itself and each other Loan Party, each Loan Party’s obligations under the Collateral Documents to which such Loan Party is a party and hereby represents and acknowledges, on behalf of itself and each other Loan Party, that the Loan Parties have no claims, counterclaims, offsets, credits or defenses to the Loan Documents or the performance of their obligations thereunder. Furthermore, the Borrower agrees, on behalf of itself and each other Loan Party, that nothing contained in this Amendment shall adversely affect any right or remedy of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders under the Collateral Documents or any of the other Loan Documents. Finally, the Borrower hereby represents and warrants, on behalf of itself and each other Loan Party, that the execution and delivery of this Amendment and the other documents executed in connection herewith shall in no way change or modify its or any other Loan Party’s obligations as a debtor, pledgor, assignor, obligor, grantor, mortgagor and/or chargor under any Collateral Document and the other Loan Documents and shall not constitute a waiver by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders of any of their rights against any Loan Party.

Section 14.     Effect of Amendment. From and after the Amendment No. 8 Effective Date, each reference in the Existing Credit Agreement to “this Agreement”, “hereof”, or “hereunder” or words of like import, and all references to the “Credit Agreement” in the Loan Documents and any and all other agreements, instruments, documents, notes, certificates, guaranties and other writings of every kind and nature shall be deemed to mean the Credit Agreement. From and after the Montage Merger Effective Date, each reference in the Credit Agreement to “this Agreement”, “hereof”, or “hereunder” or words of like import, and all references to the “Credit Agreement” in the Loan Documents and any and all other agreements, instruments, documents, notes, certificates, guaranties and other writings of every kind and nature shall be deemed to mean the Credit Agreement, giving effect to the matters provided for in Sections 4, 5, 6, 7 and 11 of this Amendment. This Amendment shall constitute a Loan Document for all purposes of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

Section 15.    Costs and Expenses. Pursuant to the terms of Section 9.03 of the Credit Agreement, the Borrower agrees to pay all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates in connection with the preparation, execution and enforcement of this Amendment.

Section 16.    Choice of Law. This Amendment and all other documents executed in connection herewith and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto and thereto, shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York.



Section 17.    Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Amendment may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Amendment, the Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. This Amendment shall become effective on the Amendment No. 8 Effective Date, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Amendment that is an Electronic Signature transmitted by telecopy, emailed pdf. or any other electronic means that reproduces an image of an actual executed signature page shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Amendment. The words “execution,” “signed,” “signature,” “delivery,” and words of like import in or relating to this Amendment shall be deemed to include Electronic Signatures, deliveries or the keeping of records in any electronic form (including deliveries by telecopy, emailed pdf. or any other electronic means that reproduces an image of an actual executed signature page), each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature, physical delivery thereof or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be.

Section 18.    Headings. Section headings in this Amendment are included herein for convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part of this Amendment for any other purpose.
