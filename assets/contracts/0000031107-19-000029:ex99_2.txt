(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (i) no representations or warranties are made with respect to the grant of a security interest in the Equity Interests of any Foreign Subsidiary, including, without limitation, whether such a grant is permitted by any applicable law or by the governing documents of such Foreign Subsidiary, and (ii) no Grantor shall be required to comply with Sections 6.01(a), (b) and (c) above with respect to Equity Interests issued by a Foreign Subsidiary that, as of the date of determination, does not have (a) Consolidated EBITDA in excess of 5.00% of the Consolidated EBITDA of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, or (b) assets in excess of 5.00% of the Borrower's consolidated total assets.
Section 6.02 No Assumption of Liability.  The security interest of any Grantor is granted as security only and shall not subject the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Creditor to, or in any way alter or modify, any obligation or liability of such Grantor with respect to or arising out of any of the Pledged Collateral.  Nothing herein shall be construed to make the Administrative Agent liable as a general partner or limited partner of any Pledged Entity or a shareholder of any corporation, and the Administrative Agent by virtue of this Agreement or any actions taken as contemplated hereby (except as referred to in the following sentence) shall not have any of the duties, obligations or liabilities of a general partner or limited partner of any Pledged Entity or a stockholder of any corporation.  The parties hereto expressly agree that, unless the Administrative Agent shall become the absolute owner of an Equity Interest pursuant hereto, this Agreement shall not be construed as creating a partnership or joint venture among the Administrative Agent and/or a Grantor or any other Person.
Section 6.03 Registration of Collateral in the Name of the Administrative Agent.  On and after the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent shall have the right, at any time in its discretion and shall endeavor to provide written notice to the applicable Grantor (it being understood that the Administrative Agent should not be liable for the failure to provide such notice), to transfer to or to register in the name of the Administrative Agent or any of its nominees any or all of the Pledged Collateral, subject only to the revocable voting and similar rights specified in this Article VI.  In addition, on and after the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent shall have the right at any time to exchange certificates or instruments representing or evidencing any Pledged Collateral for certificates or instruments of smaller or larger denominations.
Section 6.04 Appointment of Sub-Agents; Endorsements; etc.  The Administrative Agent shall have the right to appoint one or more sub-agents for the purpose of retaining physical possession of the instruments and certificates evidencing any of the Pledged Collateral, which may be held (in the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent) in the name of the relevant Grantor, endorsed or assigned in blank or in favor of the Administrative Agent or any nominee or nominees of the Administrative Agent or a sub-agent appointed by the Administrative Agent.
Section 6.05 Voting Rights.  Unless and until an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Grantor shall be entitled to exercise all voting rights attaching to any and all Pledged Collateral owned by it, and to give consents, waivers or ratifications in respect thereof, provided that no vote shall be cast or any consent, waiver or ratification given or any action taken which would violate, result in breach of any covenant contained in or be inconsistent with any of the terms of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any Designated Hedge Document, or which would have the effect of impairing the position or interests of the Administrative Agent or any Secured Creditor therein.  All such rights of such Grantor to vote and to give consents, waivers and ratifications shall cease in case an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing.
Section 6.06 Entitlement of Grantors to Cash Dividends and Distributions.  Each Grantor shall be entitled to receive all cash dividends or distributions payable in respect of its Pledged Collateral, except as otherwise provided in this Article VI.

(a) all cash dividends and distributions payable in respect of the Pledged Collateral at any time when an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;  and
(b) regardless of whether or not an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of payment or distribution thereof, and, to the extent any of the following is prohibited by the Credit Agreement: (i) all cash dividends and distributions in respect of the Pledged Collateral which are reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent to represent in whole or in part an extraordinary, liquidating or other distribution in return of capital; (ii) all other or additional stock, other securities, partnership interests, membership interests or property (other than cash to which a Grantor is entitled under Section 6.06) paid or distributed by way of dividend (including, without limitation, any payment in kind dividend) or otherwise in respect of the Pledged Collateral; (iii) all other or additional stock, other securities, partnership interests, membership interests or property (including cash) paid or distributed in respect of the Pledged Collateral by way of stock split, spin-off, split up, reclassification, combination of shares or similar rearrangement; and (iv) all other or additional stock, other securities, partnership interests, membership interests or property (including cash) which may be paid in respect of the Pledged Collateral by reason of any consolidation, merger, exchange of stock, conveyance of assets, liquidation or similar corporate, partnership or limited liability company reorganization.
Section 6.08 Application of Dividends and Distributions.  If no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at such time, the Administrative Agent will, at the request of the Borrower (on behalf of any applicable Grantor or Grantors), pay over to the Administrative Agent, for application to the payment or prepayment of any of the Loan Document Obligations, any cash held by it as Pledged Collateral which is attributable to dividends or distributions received by it and then held as part of the Collateral pursuant to this Article VI.  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, all dividends and distributions received by the Administrative Agent and then held by it pursuant to this Article VI as part of the Pledged Collateral will be applied as provided in Section 8.05 hereof.
Section 6.09 Turnover by Grantors.  All dividends, distributions or other payments that are received by any Grantor contrary to the provisions of this Agreement shall be received in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, shall be segregated from other property or funds of such Grantor and shall be forthwith paid over to the Administrative Agent as Collateral in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement).
Section 6.10 Registration under 1933 Act.  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and a Grantor shall have received from the Administrative Agent a written request or requests that such Grantor cause any registration, qualification or compliance under any Federal or state securities law or laws to be effected with respect to all or any part of the Pledged Equity Interest of its Subsidiaries, such Grantor as soon as practicable and at its expense will use its best efforts to cause such registration to be effected (and be kept effective) and will use its best efforts to cause such qualification and compliance to be effected (and be kept effective) as may be so requested and as would permit or facilitate the sale and distribution of such stock, including, without limitation, registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as then in effect (the "Securities Act") (or any similar statute then in effect), appropriate qualifications under applicable blue sky or other state securities laws and appropriate compliance with any other governmental requirements, provided that the Administrative Agent shall furnish to such Grantor such information regarding the Administrative Agent as such Grantor may request in writing and as shall be required in connection with any such registration, qualification or compliance.  The relevant Grantor will advise the Administrative Agent in writing as to the progress of each such registration, qualification or compliance and as to the completion thereof, will furnish to the Administrative Agent such number of prospectuses, offering circulars and other documents incident thereto as the Administrative Agent from time to time may reasonably request, and will indemnify the Administrative Agent and all others participating in the distribution of such Pledged Equity Interests against all claims, losses, damages or liabilities caused by any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained therein (or in any related registration statement, notification or the like) or by any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein (or in any related registration statement, notification or the like) a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as the same may have been caused by an untrue statement or omission based upon information furnished in writing to such Grantor by the Administrative Agent expressly for use therein.
Section 6.11 Sale of Pledged Equity Interests in Connection with Enforcement.  If at any time when the Administrative Agent shall determine to exercise its right to sell all or any part of the Pledged Equity Interests pursuant to Section 8.01, such Pledged Equity Interests or the part thereof to be sold shall not, for any reason whatsoever, be effectively registered under the Securities Act, as then in effect, the Administrative Agent may, in its sole and absolute discretion and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law now or hereafter in effect, sell such Pledged Equity Interests or part thereof by private sale in such manner and under such circumstances as the Administrative Agent may deem necessary or advisable in order that such sale may legally be effected without such registration, provided that at least ten (10) days' notice of the time and place of any such sale shall be given to the relevant Grantor.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in any such event the Administrative Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, (a) may proceed to make such private sale notwithstanding that a registration statement for the purpose of registering such Pledged Equity Interests or part thereof shall have been filed under such Securities Act, (b) may approach and negotiate with a single possible purchaser to effect such sale and (c) may restrict such sale to a purchaser who will represent and agree that such purchaser is purchasing for its own account, for investment, and not with a view to the distribution or sale of such Pledged Equity Interests or part thereof.  In the event of any such sale, the Administrative Agent shall incur no responsibility or liability to any Grantor for selling all or any part of the Pledged Equity Interests at a price which the Administrative Agent may in good faith deem reasonable under the circumstances, notwithstanding the possibility that a substantially higher price might be realized if the sale were deferred until the registration as aforesaid.

Each Grantor further agrees, unless otherwise directed by the Administrative Agent, diligently to prosecute any Person infringing any Significant Intellectual Property in a manner consistent with its past practice and in the ordinary course of business.

(b) Maintenance of Registration.  Each Grantor shall, at its own expense, diligently process all documents required by the Trademark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1051, et seq. to maintain trademark registration that the failure to so maintain could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, including but not limited to affidavits of use and applications for renewals of registration in the United States Patent and Trademark Office for all of its Trademarks pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §§ 1058(a), 1059 and 1065, and shall pay all fees and disbursements in connection therewith, and shall not abandon any such filing of affidavit of use or any such application of renewal prior to the exhaustion of all administrative and judicial remedies without prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
(c) Future Registered Trademarks.  If any mark registration is issued hereafter to a Grantor as a result of any application now or hereafter pending before the United States Patent and Trademark Office, then, within ten (10) Business Days (or such longer period as agreed to by the Administrative Agent) of such issuance such Grantor shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a grant of security in such mark to the Administrative Agent, confirming the grant thereof hereunder, the form of such confirmatory grant to be in form and substance acceptable to the Administrative Agent.

ARTICLE VIII. 


REMEDIES UPON OCCURRENCE OF EVENT OF DEFAULT
Section 8.01 Remedies Generally.  Each Grantor agrees that, if any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, then and in every such case, subject to any mandatory requirements of applicable law then in effect, the Administrative Agent, in addition to any rights now or hereafter existing under applicable law, shall have all rights as a secured creditor under the UCC in all relevant jurisdictions and may exercise any or all of the following rights (all of which each Grantor hereby agrees is commercially reasonable to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law now or hereafter in effect):
(a) personally, or by agents, attorneys or other authorized representatives, immediately retake possession of the Collateral or any part thereof from such Grantor or any other Person who then has possession of any part thereof with or without notice or process of law, and for that purpose may enter upon such Grantor's or such other Person's premises where any of the Collateral is located and remove the same and use in connection with such removal any and all services, supplies, aids and other facilities of such Grantor;
(b) instruct the obligor or obligors on any Account Receivable, agreement, instrument or other obligation (including, without limitation, account debtors) constituting the Collateral to make any payment required by the terms of such Account Receivable, agreement, instrument or other obligation directly to the Administrative Agent and/or directly to a lockbox under the sole dominion and control of the Administrative Agent or to the Collateral Concentration Account;
(c) sell, assign or otherwise liquidate, or direct such Grantor to sell, assign or otherwise liquidate, any or all of the Collateral or any part thereof, and take possession of the proceeds of any such sale or liquidation;
(d) issue a Notice of Exclusive Control with respect to any or all of the Collateral Accounts and issue entitlement orders or instructions with respect thereto;
(e) withdraw any or all monies, securities and/or instruments in the Collateral Concentration Account or any Collateral Account for application to the Secured Obligations in accordance with Section 8.05 hereof;
(f) pay and discharge taxes, Liens or claims on or against any of the Collateral;
(g) pay, perform or satisfy, or cause to be paid, performed or satisfied, for the benefit of any Grantor, any of the obligations, terms, covenants, provisions or conditions to be paid, observed, performed or satisfied by such Grantor under any contract, agreement or instrument relating to its Collateral, all in accordance with the terms, covenants, provisions and conditions thereof, as and to the extent that such Grantor fails or refuses to perform or satisfy the same;
(h) enter into any extension of, or any other agreement in any way relating to, any of the Collateral;
(i) make any compromise or settlement the Administrative Agent reasonably deems desirable or necessary with respect to any of the Collateral; and/or
(j) take possession of the Collateral or any part thereof, by directing such Grantor or any other Person in possession thereof in writing to deliver the same to the Administrative Agent at any place or places designated by the Administrative Agent, in which event such Grantor shall at its own expense:
(i) forthwith cause the same to be moved to the place or places so designated by the Administrative Agent and delivered to the Administrative Agent,
(ii) store and keep any Collateral so delivered to the Administrative Agent at such place or places pending further action by the Administrative Agent as provided in Section 8.02, and
(iii) while the Collateral shall be so stored and kept, provide such guards and maintenance services as shall be necessary to protect the same and to preserve and maintain them in substantially the same condition prior to such action;
it being understood that such Grantor's obligation to deliver the Collateral is of the essence of this Agreement and that, accordingly, upon application to a court of equity having jurisdiction, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to a decree requiring specific performance by such Grantor of said obligation.
Section 8.02 Disposition of the Collateral.  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, any Collateral repossessed by the Administrative Agent under or pursuant to Section 8.01 and any other Collateral whether or not so repossessed by the Administrative Agent, may be sold, assigned, leased or otherwise disposed of under one or more contracts or as an entirety, and without the necessity of gathering at the place of sale of the property to be sold, and in general in such manner, at such time or times, at such place or places and on such terms as the Administrative Agent may, in compliance with any mandatory requirements of applicable law, determine to be commercially reasonable.  Any of the Collateral may be sold, leased or otherwise disposed of, in the condition in which the same existed when taken by the Administrative Agent or after any overhaul or repair which the Administrative Agent shall determine to be commercially reasonable.  Except in the case of any Collateral that is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market, (a) in the case of any such disposition which shall be a private sale or other private proceedings permitted by such requirements, such sale shall be made upon not less than ten (10) days' written notice to such Grantor specifying the time at which such disposition is to be made and the intended sale price or other consideration therefor, and shall be subject, for the ten (10) days after the giving of such notice, to the right of the relevant Grantor or any nominee of the relevant Grantor to  acquire the Collateral involved at a price or for such other consideration at least equal to the intended sale price or other consideration so specified, and (b) in the case of any such disposition which shall be a public sale permitted by such requirements, such sale shall be made upon not less than ten (10) days' written notice to the relevant Grantor specifying the time and place of such sale and, in the absence of applicable requirements of law, shall be by public auction (which may, at the Administrative Agent's sole option, be subject to reserve), after publication of notice of such auction not less than ten (10) days prior thereto in two newspapers in general circulation in the city where such Collateral is located.  To the extent permitted by any such requirement of law, the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Secured Creditors (or certain of them) may bid for and become the purchaser (by bidding in Secured Obligations or otherwise) of the Collateral or any item thereof offered for sale in accordance with this Section without accountability to the relevant Grantor (except to the extent of surplus money received as provided in Section 8.05).  Unless so obligated under mandatory requirements of applicable law, the Administrative Agent shall not make dispositions of the Collateral within a period of time which does not permit the giving of notice to the Grantor as hereinabove specified.  The Administrative Agent need give the relevant Grantor only such notice of disposition as the Administrative Agent shall deem to be reasonably practicable in view of such mandatory requirements of applicable law.
Section 8.03 Grant of License to Use Intellectual Property.  For the purpose of enabling the Administrative Agent to exercise rights and remedies under this Article VIII at such time as the Administrative Agent shall be lawfully entitled to exercise such rights and remedies and for no other purpose, each Grantor hereby grants to the Administrative Agent an irrevocable, non-exclusive license (exercisable without payment of royalty or other compensation to the Grantor) to use, assign or sublicense any of the Intellectual Property of such Grantor, now owned or hereafter acquired by such Grantor, and wherever the same may be located, including in such license reasonable access to all media in which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all computer programs used for the compilation or printout thereof.
Section 8.04 Waiver of Claims.  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Grantor hereby waives, to the extent permitted by law: (a) all damages occasioned by any taking of possession of the Collateral as permitted hereunder except any damages which are the direct result of the Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct; (b) all other requirements as to the time, place and terms of sale or other requirements with respect to the enforcement of the Administrative Agent's rights hereunder; and (c) all rights of redemption, appraisement, valuation, stay, extension or moratorium now or hereafter in force under any applicable law in order to prevent or delay the enforcement of this Agreement or the absolute sale of the Collateral or any portion thereof, and each Grantor, for itself and all who may claim under it, insofar as it or they now or hereafter lawfully may, hereby waives the benefit of all such laws to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law now or hereafter in effect.  Any sale of, or the grant of options to purchase, or any other realization upon, any Collateral shall operate to divest all right, title, interest, claim and demand, either at law or in equity, of the relevant Grantor therein and thereto, and shall be a perpetual bar both at law and in equity against the relevant Grantor and against any and all Persons claiming or attempting to claim the Collateral so sold, optioned or realized upon, or any part thereof, from, through and under the relevant Grantor.
Section 8.05 Application of Proceeds.  All Collateral and proceeds of Collateral obtained and realized by the Administrative Agent in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement pursuant to this Article VIII shall be applied as follows:
(i) first, to the payment  to the Administrative Agent, for application to the Secured Obligations as provided in Section 8.03 of the Credit Agreement; and
(ii) second, to the extent remaining after the application pursuant to the preceding clause (i) and following the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.09 hereof, to the relevant Grantor or to whomever may be lawfully entitled to receive such payment.
Section 8.06 Remedies Cumulative.  Each and every right, power and remedy hereby specifically given to the Administrative Agent shall be in addition to every other right, power and remedy specifically given under this Agreement, any Designated Hedge Document or the other Loan Documents or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity, or by statute, and each and every right, power and remedy whether specifically herein given or otherwise existing may be exercised from time to time or simultaneously and as often and in such order as may be deemed expedient by the Administrative Agent.  All such rights, powers and remedies shall be cumulative and the exercise or the beginning of exercise of one shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to exercise any other or others.  No delay or omission of the Administrative Agent in the exercise of any such right, power or remedy, or partial or single exercise thereof, and no renewal or extension of any of the Secured Obligations, shall impair or constitute a waiver of any such right, power or remedy or shall be construed to be a waiver of any Default or Event of Default or an acquiescence therein.  No notice to or demand on any Grantor in any case shall entitle it to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of any of the rights of the Administrative Agent to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.  In the event that the Administrative Agent shall bring any suit to enforce any of its rights hereunder and shall be entitled to judgment, then in such suit the Administrative Agent may recover reasonable, actual expenses, including attorneys' fees, and the amounts thereof shall be included in such judgment.
Section 8.07 Discontinuance of Proceedings.  In case the Administrative Agent shall have instituted any proceeding to enforce any right, power or remedy under this Agreement by foreclosure, sale, entry or otherwise, and such proceeding shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason or shall have been determined adversely to the Administrative Agent, then and in every such case the relevant Grantor, the Administrative Agent and each holder of any of the Secured Obligations shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder with respect to the Collateral subject to the security interest created under this Agreement, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Administrative Agent shall continue as if no such proceeding had been instituted.
Section 8.08 Purchasers of Collateral.  Upon any sale of any of the Collateral by the Administrative Agent hereunder (whether by virtue of the power of sale herein granted, pursuant to judicial process or otherwise), the receipt of the Administrative Agent or the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Collateral so sold, and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over to the Administrative Agent or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication or nonapplication thereof.

Section 9.07 Enforcement Expenses, etc.  The Grantors hereby jointly and severally agree to pay, to the extent not paid pursuant to Section 11.01 of the Credit Agreement, all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent and each other Secured Creditor in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement, the preservation of the Collateral, the perfection of the security interest, and any amendment, waiver or consent relating hereto (including, without limitation, the fees and disbursements of counsel employed by the Administrative Agent or any of the other Secured Creditors).
Section 9.08 Release of Portions of Collateral.
(a) So long as no Event of Default is in existence or would exist after the application of proceeds as provided below, the Administrative Agent shall, at the request of a Grantor, release any or all of the Collateral of such Grantor, provided that (i) such release is permitted by the terms of the Credit Agreement (it being agreed for such purposes that a release will be deemed "permitted by the terms of the Credit Agreement" if the proposed transaction constitutes an exception contained in Section 7.02 of the Credit Agreement) or otherwise has been approved in writing by the Required Lenders (or, to the extent required by Section 11.12 of the Credit Agreement, all of the applicable Lenders) and (ii) the proceeds of such Collateral are to be applied as required pursuant to the Credit Agreement or any consent or waiver entered into with respect thereto.
(b) At any time that a Grantor desires that the Administrative Agent take any action to give effect to any release of Collateral pursuant to the foregoing Section 9.08(a), it shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate signed by a principal executive officer stating that the release of the respective Collateral is permitted pursuant to Section 9.08(a).  In the event that any part of the Collateral is released as provided in Section 9.08(a), the Administrative Agent, at the request and expense of a Grantor, will duly release such Collateral and assign, transfer and deliver to such Grantor (without recourse and without any representation or warranty) such of the Collateral as is then being (or has been) so sold and as may be in the possession of the Administrative Agent and has not theretofore been released pursuant to this Agreement.  The Administrative Agent shall have no liability whatsoever to any Secured Creditor as the result of any release of Collateral by it as permitted by this Section 9.08.
Section 9.09 Termination.  After the termination of all of the Commitments and all Designated Hedge Documents, when no LC Outstandings are outstanding and when all Loans and other Secured Obligations (other than unasserted indemnity obligations) have been paid in full, this Agreement shall terminate, and the Administrative Agent, at the request and expense of the Grantors, will execute and deliver to the relevant Grantor a proper instrument or instruments (including, without limitation, UCC termination statements on form UCC-3) acknowledging the satisfaction and termination of this Agreement, and will duly assign, transfer and deliver to the relevant Grantor (without recourse and without any representation or warranty) such of the Collateral as may be in the possession of the Administrative Agent and as has not theretofore been sold or otherwise applied or released pursuant to this Agreement.
Section 9.10 Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent will hold in accordance with this Agreement all items of the Collateral at any time received under this Agreement.  The acceptance by the Administrative Agent of this Agreement, with all the rights, powers, privileges and authority so created, shall not at any time or in any event obligate the Administrative Agent to appear in or defend any action or proceeding relating to the Collateral to which it is not a party, or to take any action hereunder or thereunder, or to expend any money or incur any expenses or perform or discharge any obligation, duty or liability under the Collateral.  By accepting the benefits of this Agreement, each Secured Creditor acknowledges and agrees that the rights and obligations of the Administrative Agent shall be as set forth in Article IX of the Credit Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 9.03 of this Agreement or Section 11.12 of the Credit Agreement, this Section 9.10, and the duties and obligations of the Administrative Agent set forth in this Section 9.10, may not be amended or modified without the consent of the Administrative Agent.
Section 9.11 Only Administrative Agent to Enforce on Behalf of Secured Creditors.  The Secured Creditors agree by their acceptance of the benefits hereof that this Agreement may be enforced on their behalf only by the action of the Administrative Agent, acting upon the instructions of the Required Lenders (or, after all Loan Document Obligations have been paid in full, instructions of the holders of at least 51% of the outstanding Designated Hedge Document Obligations) and that no other Secured Creditor shall have any right individually to seek to enforce or to enforce this Agreement or to realize upon the security to be granted hereby, it being understood and agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised by the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Creditors, upon the terms of this Agreement.
Section 9.12 Other Creditors, etc. Not Third-Party Beneficiaries.  No creditor of any Grantor or any of its Affiliates, or other Person claiming by, through or under any Grantor or any of its Affiliates, other than the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Creditors, and their respective successors and assigns, shall be a beneficiary or third-party beneficiary of this Agreement or otherwise shall derive any right or benefit herefrom.
Section 9.13 Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto on separate counterparts, including via facsimile transmission or other electronic transmission capable of authentication, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of which shall together constitute one and the same agreement.  A set of counterparts executed by all the parties hereto shall be lodged with the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.
Section 9.14 Amendments; Additional Grantors.  No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement and no consent to any departure by any Grantor shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent acting at the direction of the requisite number of Lenders, if any, required pursuant to Section 11.12 of the Credit Agreement, and the applicable Grantor or Grantors, as the case may be, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given.  Upon the execution and delivery by any Person of a Security Agreement Joinder, (a) such Person shall be referred to as an "Additional Grantor" and shall become and be a Grantor hereunder, and each reference in this Agreement to a "Grantor" shall also mean and be a reference to such Additional Grantor, and each reference in any other Loan Document to a "Grantor" shall also mean and be a reference to such Additional Grantor, and (b) each reference herein to "this Agreement," "hereunder," "hereof" or words of like import referring to this Agreement, and each reference in any other Loan Document to the "Security Agreement," "thereunder," "thereof" or words of like import referring to this Agreement, shall mean and be a reference to this Agreement as supplemented by such Security Agreement Joinder.
Section 9.15 Separate Actions.  A separate action may be brought and prosecuted against any Grantor, any other guarantor or obligor or the Borrower, and whether any other Grantor, any other guarantor or obligor or the Borrower be joined in such action or actions.
Section 9.16 Full Recourse Obligations; Effect of Fraudulent Transfer Laws.  It is the desire and intent of each Grantor, the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Creditors that this Agreement shall be enforced as a full recourse obligation of each Grantor to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought.  If and to the extent that the obligations of any Grantor under this Agreement would, in the absence of this sentence, be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable because of any applicable state or federal law relating to fraudulent conveyances or transfers, then the amount of such Grantor liability hereunder in respect of the Secured Obligations shall be deemed to be reduced ab initio to that maximum amount that would be permitted without causing such Grantor's obligations hereunder to be so invalidated.
Section 9.17 Governing Law; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial.
(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES.
(b) ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT   MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SITTING IN NEW YORK CITY OR OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF SUCH STATE, AND BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH GRANTOR CONSENTS, FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THOSE COURTS.  EACH GRANTOR IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION, INCLUDING ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OR BASED ON THE GROUNDS OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS, WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE BRINGING OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN SUCH JURISDICTION IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHER DOCUMENT RELATED THERETO.  EACH GRANTOR WAIVES PERSONAL SERVICE OF ANY SUMMONS, COMPLAINT OR OTHER PROCESS, WHICH MAY BE MADE BY ANY OTHER MEANS PERMITTED BY THE LAW OF SUCH STATE.
(c) THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND EACH GRANTOR HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO OR ANY OF THEM WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED THERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER FOUNDED IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE; AND EACH GRANTOR HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND THAT ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION 9.17 WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE SIGNATORIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.
Section 9.18 Acknowledgement Regarding Any Support QFCs.  The provisions and acknowledgements contained in Section 11.31 of the Credit Agreement are hereby incorporated into this Security Agreement, mutatis mutandis.
