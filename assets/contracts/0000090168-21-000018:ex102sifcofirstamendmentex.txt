FIRST AMENDMENT TO EXPORT CREDIT AGREEMENT

    THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO EXPORT CREDIT AGREEMENT, dated as of February 19, 2021 (this "Amendment"), is by and among SIFCO Industries, Inc., an Ohio corporation (“SIFCO”), and Quality Aluminum Forge, LLC, an Ohio limited liability company (“Quality Forge” and, together with SIFCO, collectively, the “Borrowers” and each, individually, a “Borrower”), any other Loan Parties party hereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., a national banking association (the “Lender”).

RECITALS

    A.    The Borrowers, any other Loan Parties party thereto, and the Lender are parties to an Export Credit Agreement dated as of December 17, 2018 (as amended and as it may be further amended or modified from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”).

    B.    The Borrowers and any other Loan Parties desire to amend the Credit Agreement, and the Lender is willing to do so in accordance with the terms hereof.

    TERMS

    In consideration of the premises and of the mutual agreements herein contained, the parties agree as follows:

    ARTICLE I. AMENDMENTS. Upon fulfillment of the conditions set forth in Article III hereof, the Credit Agreement shall be amended effective as of the date hereof as follows:

    1.1    Section 1.05 of the Credit Agreement is restated as follows:

    SECTION 1.05.    Interest Rates; LIBOR Notifications. The interest rate on Eurodollar Loans is determined by reference to the LIBO Rate, which is derived from the London interbank offered rate. REVLIBOR30 Screen Rate, used for determining the REVLIBOR30 Rate (Loans accruing interest at such rate, the “REVLIBOR30 Rate Loans”) is also derived from the London interbank offered rate. The London interbank offered rate is intended to represent the rate at which contributing banks may obtain short-term borrowings from each other in the London interbank market. In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that, after the end of 2021, it would no longer persuade or compel contributing banks to make rate submissions to the ICE Benchmark Administration (together with any successor to the ICE Benchmark Administrator, the “IBA”) for purposes of the IBA setting the London interbank offered rate. As a result, it is possible that commencing in 2022, the London interbank offered rate may no longer be available or may no longer be deemed an appropriate reference rate upon which to determine the interest rate on REVLIBOR30 Rate Loans and/or Eurodollar Loans. In light of this eventuality, public and private sector industry initiatives are currently underway to identify new or alternative reference rates to be used in place of the London interbank offered rate. In the event that a Benchmark Transition Event occurs, Section 2.13 provides a mechanism for determining an alternate rate of interest. The Lender will notify the Borrower Representative in advance of any change to the reference rate upon which the interest rate on REVLIBOR30 Rate Loans and/or Eurodollar Loans is based. However, the Lender does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission or any other matter related to the London interbank offered rate or other rates in the definitions of “REVLIBOR30 Screen Rate” and “LIBO Rate” or with respect to any alternative or successor rates thereto, or replacement rates thereof, including without limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate, as it may or may not be adjusted, will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic

equivalence of, the REVLIBOR30 Screen Rate or the LIBO Rate or have the same volume or liquidity as did the London interbank offered rate prior to its discontinuance or unavailability.

    1.2    The following is added to the beginning of Section 2.13(a) of the Credit Agreement: “Subject to clause (c) of this Section 2.13,”.     

    1.3    The following is added to the end of Section 2.13(a)(1) of the Credit Agreement prior to the “and” therein: “provided that no Benchmark Transition Event shall have occurred at such time;”.

    1.4    Section 2.13(a)(2) of the Credit Agreement is restated as follows:

    (2)     the Lender determines the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for a Loan bearing interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lender of making or maintaining its Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;

    1.5    The following new Section 2.13(c) is added to the Credit Agreement:

    (c)    If a Benchmark Transition Event occurs, then the Lender may, by notice to the Borrower representative, select an alternative rate of interest for the REVLIBOR30 Rate and the LIBO Rate that gives due consideration to the then-evolving or prevailing market convention for determining a rate of interest for loans in U.S. Dollars at such time (the “Alternate Rate”); the Borrowers acknowledge that the Alternate Rate may include a mathematical adjustment using any then-evolving or prevailing market convention or method for determining a spread adjustment for the replacement of the REVLIBOR30 Rate and the LIBO Rate, as applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, all references to the REVLIBOR30 Rate and the LIBO Rate, shall be deemed to be references to the Alternate Rate when the Alternate Rate becomes effective in accordance with this Section. In addition, the Lender will have the right, from time to time by notice to the Borrower Representative, to make technical, administrative or operational changes (including, without limitation, changes to the definition of “CB Floating Rate”, the definition of “Interest Period”, timing and frequency of determining rates and making payments of interest and other administrative matters) that the Lender decides in its reasonable discretion may be appropriate to reflect the adoption and implementation of the Alternate Rate. The Alternate Rate, together with all such technical, administrative and operational changes as specified in any notice, shall become effective at the later of (i) the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Lender has provided notice to the Borrower Representative (the “Notice Date”) and (ii) a date specified by the Lender in the notice, without any further action or consent of the Borrowers, so long as the Lender has not received, by 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on the Notice Date, written notice of objection to the Alternate Rate from the Borrower Representative. Any determination, decision, or election that may be made by the Lender pursuant to this Section, including any determination with respect to a rate or adjustment or the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date, and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its sole discretion and without consent from the Borrowers, other than as provided in the immediately preceding sentence with respect to the Borrower Representative’s right to provide an objection to the Alternate Rate. Until an Alternate Rate shall be determined in accordance with this Section, the interest rate on REVLIBOR30 Rate Loans and Eurodollar Loans shall be equal to the sum of (A) the greater of (x) Prime Rate and (y) 2.50%, plus (B) the Applicable Margin for CBFR Loans. In no event shall the Alternate Rate be less than 0.00%.

    1.6    Section 3.16(a) of the Credit Agreement is restated as follows: “(a) Permitted Encumbrances and other Liens permitted by the Domestic Credit Agreement, to the extent such Liens would have priority over the Liens in favor of the Lender pursuant to any applicable law or agreement,”
