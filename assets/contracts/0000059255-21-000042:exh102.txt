(iii) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor hereby waives:  (A) any right to assert against any member of the Lender Group or any Bank Product Provider, any defense (legal or equitable) (other than the defense that all of the Guarantied Obligations have been paid in full), set-off, counterclaim, or claim which each Guarantor may now or at any time hereafter have against any Borrower (other than Canadian Borrower) or any other party liable to any member of the Lender Group or any Bank Product Provider, (B) any defense, set-off, counterclaim, or claim, of any kind or nature, arising directly or indirectly from the present or future lack of perfection, sufficiency, validity, or enforceability of the Guarantied Obligations or any security therefor, (C) any right or defense arising by reason of any claim or defense based upon an election of remedies by any member of the Lender Group or any Bank Product Provider including any defense based upon an impairment or elimination of such Guarantor's rights of subrogation, reimbursement, contribution, or indemnity of such Guarantor against any Borrower (other than Canadian Borrower) or other guarantors or sureties, and (D) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting such Guarantor's liability hereunder or the enforcement thereof, and any act which shall defer or delay the operation of any statute of limitations applicable to the Guarantied Obligations shall similarly operate to defer or delay the operation of such statute of limitations applicable to such Guarantor's liability hereunder.
- 12 -
(iv) No Guarantor will exercise any rights that it may now or hereafter acquire against any Grantor or any other guarantor that arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of such Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty, including any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of Agent, any other member of the Lender Group, or any Bank Product Provider against any Grantor or any other guarantor or any Collateral, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law, including the right to take or receive from any Grantor or any other guarantor, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security solely on account of such claim, remedy or right, unless and until all of the Guarantied Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full in cash and all of the Commitments have been terminated.  If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor in violation of the immediately preceding sentence, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of Agent, for the benefit of the Lender Group and the Bank Product Providers, and shall forthwith be paid to Agent to be credited and applied to the Guarantied Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, or to be held as Collateral for any Guarantied Obligations or other amounts payable under this Guaranty thereafter arising.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Guaranty, no Guarantor may exercise any rights of subrogation, contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or other similar rights against, and may not proceed or seek recourse against or with respect to any property or asset of, any other Grantor (the "Foreclosed Grantor"), including after payment in full of the Obligations, if all or any portion of the Obligations have been satisfied in connection with an exercise of remedies in respect of the Equity Interests of such Foreclosed Grantor whether pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise.
(v) Each of the Guarantors represents, warrants, and agrees that each of the waivers set forth above is made with full knowledge of its significance and consequences and that if any of such waivers are determined to be contrary to any applicable law or public policy, such waivers shall be effective to the maximum extent permitted by law.

4. Security for Secured Obligations.  The Security Interest created hereby secures the payment and performance of the Secured Obligations, whether now existing or arising hereafter.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this Agreement secures the payment of all amounts which constitute part of the Secured Obligations and would be owed by Grantors, or any of them, to Agent, the Lender Group, the Bank Product Providers or any of them, but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable (in whole or in part) as a claim in an Insolvency Proceeding involving any Grantor due to the existence of such Insolvency Proceeding.  Further, the Security Interest created hereby encumbers each Grantor's right, title, and interest in all Collateral, whether now owned by such Grantor or hereafter acquired, obtained,  developed, or created by such Grantor and wherever located.
5. Grantors Remain Liable.  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, (a) each of the Grantors shall remain liable under the contracts and agreements included in the Collateral to perform all of the duties and obligations thereunder to the same extent as if this Agreement had not been executed, (b) the exercise by Agent or any other member of the Lender Group of any of the rights hereunder shall not release any Grantor from any of its duties or obligations under such contracts and agreements included in the Collateral, and (c) none of the members of the Lender Group shall have any obligation or liability under such contracts and agreements included in the Collateral by reason of this Agreement, nor shall any of the members of the Lender Group be obligated to perform any of the obligations or duties of any Grantors thereunder or to take any action to collect or enforce any claim for payment assigned hereunder.  Until an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Credit Agreement, or any other Loan Document, Grantors shall have the right to possession and enjoyment of the Collateral for the purpose of conducting the ordinary course of their respective businesses, subject to and upon the terms hereof and of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
6. Representations and Warranties.  In order to induce Agent to enter into this Agreement for the benefit of the Lender Group and the Bank Product Providers, each Grantor makes the following representations and warranties to the Lender Group which shall be true, correct, and complete, in all material respects (except that such materiality qualifier shall not be applicable to any representations and warranties that already are qualified or modified by materiality in the text thereof), as of the Closing Date, and shall be true, correct, and complete, in all material respects (except that such materiality qualifier shall not be applicable to any representations and warranties that already are qualified or modified by materiality in the text thereof), as of the date of the making of each Revolving Loan (or other extension of credit) made thereafter, as though made on and as of the date of such Revolving Loan (or other extension of credit) (except to the extent that such representations and warranties relate solely to an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all material respects (except that such materiality qualifier shall not be applicable to any representations and warranties that already are qualified or modified by materiality in the text thereof) as of such earlier date) and such representations and warranties shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement:

(e) This Agreement creates a valid security interest in the Collateral of each Grantor, to the extent a security interest therein can be created under the Code, securing the payment of the Secured Obligations.  Except to the extent a security interest in the Collateral cannot be perfected by the filing of a financing statement under the Code, all filings and other actions necessary or desirable to perfect and protect such security interest have been duly taken or will have been taken upon the filing of financing statements listing each applicable Grantor, as a debtor, and Agent, as secured party, in the jurisdictions listed next to such Grantor's name on Schedule 4.  Upon the making of such filings, Agent shall have a first priority (subject only to Permitted Liens which are non-consensual Permitted Liens, permitted purchase money Liens, or the interests of lessors under Capital Leases) perfected security interest in the Collateral of each Grantor to the extent such security interest can be perfected by the filing of a financing statement under the Code.

The inclusion of Proceeds in the Collateral shall not be deemed to constitute Agent's consent to any sale or other disposition of any of the Collateral except as expressly permitted in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.
(f) Controlled Accounts; Controlled Investments.
(i) Subject to any applicable time periods provided under Schedule 3.6 to the Credit Agreement, each Grantor shall (A) establish and maintain cash management services of a type and on terms reasonably satisfactory to Agent at Wells Fargo or one or more of the other banks set forth on Schedule 3 (each a "Controlled Account Bank"), and shall take reasonable steps to ensure that all of its Account Debtors forward payment of the amounts owed by them directly to a Collection Account at such Controlled Account Bank that is not an Excluded Account (each, a "Controlled Account") (by wire transfer to the applicable Controlled Account Bank or to a lockbox maintained by the applicable Controlled Account Bank for deposit into such Collection Account), and (B) deposit or cause to be deposited promptly, and in any event no later than the first Business Day after the date of receipt thereof, all of their Collections (including those sent directly by their Account Debtors to a Grantor) and proceeds of Collateral into a Controlled Account.

- 18 -

Each Grantor shall close any of its Controlled Accounts (and establish replacement Controlled Account accounts in accordance with the foregoing sentence) as promptly as practicable and in any event within forty-five (45) days after notice from Agent that the operating performance, funds transfer, or availability procedures or performance of the Controlled Account Bank with respect to Controlled Account Accounts or Agent's liability under any Controlled Account Agreement with such Controlled Account Bank is no longer acceptable in Agent's reasonable judgment.
(iv) Subject to any applicable time periods provided under Schedule 3.6 to the Credit Agreement, other than with respect to Excluded Accounts, no Grantor will make, acquire, or permit to exist Permitted Investments consisting of cash, Cash Equivalents, or amounts credited to Deposit Accounts or Securities Accounts, unless such Grantor and the applicable bank or securities intermediary have entered into Control Agreements governing such Permitted Investments in order to perfect (or further establish) Agent's Liens in such Permitted Investments.

Except for the safe custody of any Collateral in its actual possession and the accounting for moneys actually received by it hereunder, Agent shall have no duty as to any Collateral or as to the taking of any necessary steps to preserve rights against prior parties or any other rights pertaining to any Collateral.  Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any Collateral in its actual possession if such Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which Agent accords its own property.
- 21 -
14. Collection of Accounts, General Intangibles and Negotiable Collateral.  At any time upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Agent or Agent's designee may (a) make direct verification from Account Debtors with respect to any or all Accounts that are part of the Collateral, (b) notify Account Debtors of any Grantor that the Accounts, General Intangibles, Chattel Paper or Negotiable Collateral (in each case, that constitute Collateral) of such Grantor have been assigned to Agent, for the benefit of the Lender Group and the Bank Product Providers, or that Agent has a security interest therein, or (c) collect the Accounts, General Intangibles and Negotiable Collateral (in each case, that constitute Collateral) of any Grantor directly, and any collection costs and expenses shall constitute part of such Grantor's Secured Obligations under the Loan Documents.
15. Remedies.  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default:
(a) Agent may, and, at the instruction of the Required Lenders, shall exercise in respect of the Collateral, in addition to other rights and remedies provided for herein, in the other Loan Documents, or otherwise available to it, all the rights and remedies of a secured party on default under the Code or any other applicable law.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Grantor expressly agrees that, in any such event, Agent without demand of performance or other demand, advertisement or notice of any kind (except a notice specified below of time and place of public or private sale) to or upon any Grantor or any other Person (all and each of which demands, advertisements and notices are hereby expressly waived to the maximum extent permitted by the Code or any other applicable law), may take immediate possession of all or any portion of the Collateral and (i) require Grantors to, and each Grantor hereby agrees that it will at its own expense and upon request of Agent forthwith, assemble all or part of the Collateral as directed by Agent and make it available to Agent at one or more locations where such Grantor regularly maintains Inventory, and (ii) without notice except as specified below, sell the Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any of Agent's offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit, and upon such other terms as Agent may deem commercially reasonable.  Each Grantor agrees that, to the extent notification of sale shall be required by law, at least ten (10) days notification by mail to the applicable Grantor of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification and specifically such notification shall constitute a reasonable "authenticated notification of disposition" within the meaning of Section 9-611 of the Code.  Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notification of sale having been given.  Agent may adjourn any public sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned.  Each Grantor agrees that (A) the internet shall constitute a "place" for purposes of Section 9-610(b) of the Code and (B) to the extent notification of sale shall be required by law, notification by mail of the URL where a sale will occur and the time when a sale will commence at least ten (10) days prior to the sale shall constitute a reasonable notification for purposes of Section 9-611(b) of the Code.  Each Grantor agrees that any sale of Collateral to a licensor pursuant to the terms of a license agreement between such licensor and a Grantor is sufficient to constitute a commercially reasonable sale (including as to method, terms, manner, and time) within the meaning of Section 9-610 of the Code.
- 22 -
(b) Agent is hereby granted a license or other right to use, without liability for royalties or any other charge, each Grantor's Intellectual Property, including but not limited to, any labels, Patents, Trademarks, trade names, URLs, domain names, industrial designs, Copyrights, and advertising matter, whether owned by any Grantor or with respect to which any Grantor has rights under license, sublicense, or other agreements (including any Intellectual Property License), as it pertains to the Collateral solely for purposes of preparing for sale, advertising for sale and selling any Collateral.
(c) Agent may, in addition to other rights and remedies provided for herein, in the other Loan Documents, or otherwise available to it under applicable law and without the requirement of notice to or upon any Grantor or any other Person (which notice is hereby expressly waived to the maximum extent permitted by the Code or any other applicable law), (i) with respect to any Grantor's Deposit Accounts (other than Escrow/Trust Accounts, Governmental Authority Obligation Accounts and Non-Loan Party Proceeds Accounts) in which Agent's Liens are perfected by control under Section 9-104 of the Code, instruct the bank maintaining such Deposit Account for the applicable Grantor to pay the balance of such Deposit Account to or for the benefit of Agent, and (ii) with respect to any Grantor's Securities Accounts (other than Excluded Securities Accounts) in which Agent's Liens are perfected by control under Section 9-106 of the Code, instruct the securities intermediary maintaining such Securities Account for the applicable Grantor to (A) transfer any cash in such Securities Account to or for the benefit of Agent, or (B) liquidate any financial assets in such Securities Account that are customarily sold on a recognized market and transfer the cash proceeds thereof to or for the benefit of Agent.
(d) Any cash held by Agent as Collateral and all cash proceeds received by Agent in respect of any sale of, collection from, or other realization upon all or any part of the Collateral shall be applied against the Secured Obligations in the order set forth in the Credit Agreement.   In the event the proceeds of Collateral are insufficient to satisfy all of the Secured Obligations in full, each Grantor shall remain jointly and severally liable for any such deficiency.

- 23 -
17. Marshaling.  Agent  shall not be required to marshal any present or future collateral security (including but not limited to the Collateral) for, or other assurances of payment of, the Secured Obligations or any of them or to resort to such collateral security or other assurances of payment in any particular order, and all of its rights and remedies hereunder and in respect of such collateral security and other assurances of payment shall be cumulative and in addition to all other rights and remedies, however existing or arising.  To the extent that it lawfully may, each Grantor hereby agrees that it will not invoke any law relating to the marshaling of collateral which might cause delay in or impede the enforcement of Agent's rights and remedies under this Agreement or under any other instrument creating or evidencing any of the Secured Obligations or under which any of the Secured Obligations is outstanding or by which any of the Secured Obligations is secured or payment thereof is otherwise assured, and, to the extent that it lawfully may, each Grantor hereby irrevocably waives the benefits of all such laws.
18. Indemnity.  Each Grantor agrees to indemnify Agent, the other members of the Lender Group, and the Bank Product Providers from and against all claims, lawsuits and liabilities (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or resulting from this Agreement (including enforcement of this Agreement) or any other Loan Document to which such Grantor is a party in accordance with and to the extent set forth in Section 10.3 of the Credit Agreement.

No amendment of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Agent and each Grantor to which such amendment applies.
20. Addresses for Notices.  All notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be given in the form and manner and delivered to Agent at its address specified in the Credit Agreement, and to any of the Grantors at the notice address specified for Borrowers in the Credit Agreement, or, as to any party, at such other address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to the other party.
- 24 -
21. Continuing Security Interest: Assignments under Credit Agreement.
(a) This Agreement shall create a continuing security interest in the Collateral and shall (i) remain in full force and effect until the Obligations have been paid in full in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement and the Commitments have expired or have been terminated, (ii) be binding upon each Grantor, and their respective successors and assigns, and (iii) inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, Agent, and its successors, transferees and assigns.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause (iii), any Lender may, in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement, assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of its rights and obligations under the Credit Agreement to any other Person, and such other Person shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted to such Lender herein or otherwise.  Upon payment in full of the Secured Obligations in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement and the expiration or termination of the Commitments, the Guaranty made and the Security Interest granted hereby shall terminate and all rights to the Collateral shall revert to Grantors or any other Person entitled thereto.  At such time, upon Borrowers' request, Agent will authorize the filing of appropriate termination statements to terminate such Security Interest.  No transfer or renewal, extension, assignment, or termination of this Agreement or of the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any other instrument or document executed and delivered by any Grantor to Agent nor any additional Revolving Loans or other loans made by any Lender to any Borrower, nor the taking of further security, nor the retaking or re-delivery of the Collateral to Grantors, or any of them, by Agent, nor any other act of the Lender Group or the Bank Product Providers, or any of them, shall release any Grantor from any obligation, except a release or discharge executed in writing by Agent in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement.  Agent shall not by any act, delay, omission or otherwise, be deemed to have waived any of its rights or remedies hereunder, unless such waiver is in writing and signed by Agent and then only to the extent therein set forth.  A waiver by Agent of any right or remedy on any occasion shall not be construed as a bar to the exercise of any such right or remedy which Agent would otherwise have had on any other occasion.
(b) If any member of the Lender Group or any Bank Product Provider repays, refunds, restores, or returns in whole or in part, any payment or property (including any proceeds of Collateral) previously paid or transferred to such member of the Lender Group or such Bank Product Provider in full or partial satisfaction of any Secured Obligation or on account of any other obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document or any Bank Product Agreement, because the payment, transfer, or the incurrence of the obligation so satisfied is asserted or declared to be void, voidable, or otherwise recoverable under any law relating to creditors' rights, including provisions of the Bankruptcy Code relating to fraudulent transfers, preferences, or other voidable or recoverable obligations or transfers (each, a "Voidable Transfer"), or because such member of the Lender Group or Bank Product Provider elects to do so on the reasonable advice of its counsel in connection with a claim that the payment, transfer, or incurrence is or may be a Voidable Transfer, then, as to any such Voidable Transfer, or the amount thereof that such member of the Lender Group or Bank Product Provider elects to repay, restore, or return (including pursuant to a settlement of any claim in respect thereof), and as to all reasonable costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees of such member of the Lender Group or Bank Product Provider related thereto, (i) the liability of the Loan Parties with respect to the amount or property paid, refunded, restored, or returned will automatically and immediately be revived, reinstated, and restored and will exist, and (ii) Agent's Liens securing such liability shall be effective, revived, and remain in full force and effect, in each case, as fully as if such Voidable Transfer had never been made.  If, prior to any of the foregoing, (A) Agent's Liens shall have been released or terminated, or (B) any provision of this Agreement shall have been terminated or cancelled, Agent's Liens, or such provision of this Agreement, shall be reinstated in full force and effect and such prior release, termination, cancellation or surrender shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligation of any Loan Party in respect of such liability or any Collateral securing such liability.
- 25 -
22. Survival.  All representations and warranties made by the Grantors in this Agreement and in the certificates or other instru-ments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that Agent, Issuing Lender, or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or Event of Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended under the Credit Agreement, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any loan or any fee or any other amount payable under the Credit Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated.
