(b)    The execution, delivery and performance by each Borrower of this Amendment, and of the performance of the Credit Agreement, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate and other action and do not and will not require any registration with, consent or approval of, or notice to or action by, any Person (including any Governmental Authority) in order to be effective and enforceable.

(c)    The Amendment Documents constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of each Borrower, enforceable against it in accordance with their respective terms, subject to the effect of applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, arrangement, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and the application of general principles of equity.

(d)    All representations and warranties of each Borrower contained in Article V of the Existing Credit Agreement and the Credit Agreement are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Effective Date immediately before (in the case of the Existing Credit Agreement) and immediately after (in the case of the Credit Agreement) giving effect to this Amendment, except (i) to the extent that such representations and warranties are qualified by materiality, they shall be true and correct on and as of the Effective Date, and (ii) to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier


date, they shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date except to the extent qualified by materiality, then they shall be true and correct as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this Section 3(d) and Section 4(a)(2), the representations and warranties contained in subsections (a) and (b) of Section 5.05 of the Credit Agreement shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to clauses (a) and (b), respectively, of Section 6.01 of the Credit Agreement.

4.
Conditions of Effectiveness.

(a)    The effectiveness of Section 2 of this Amendment shall be subject to the satisfaction of each of the following conditions precedent:

(1)    The Administrative Agent shall have received from each Borrower, each L/C Issuer, the Required Lenders, the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent, a duly executed original (or, if elected by the Administrative Agent, an executed facsimile or “pdf” copy with originals to follow) of this Amendment.

(2)    The representations and warranties in Section 3 of this Amendment shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Effective Date immediately before (in the case of the Existing Credit Agreement) and immediately after (in the case of the Credit Agreement) giving effect to this Amendment, with the same effect as if made on and as of the Effective Date, except (i) to the extent that such representations and warranties are qualified by materiality, they shall be true and correct on and as of the Effective Date, and (ii) to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, they shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date except to the extent qualified by materiality, then they shall be true and correct as of such earlier date.

(3)    No Default has occurred and is continuing (or would result from the amendment of the Existing Credit Agreement contemplated hereby).

(b)    For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in Section 4(a), each Lender that has signed this Amendment shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from such Lender prior to the Effective Date specifying its objection thereto.

(c)    From and after the Effective Date, the Credit Agreement is amended as set forth herein. Except as expressly amended pursuant hereto, the Credit Agreement shall remain unchanged and in full force and effect and is hereby ratified and confirmed in all respects.

(d)    The Administrative Agent will notify the Company and the Lenders of the occurrence of the Effective Date.

6.
Miscellaneous.

(a)    The Company acknowledges and agrees that the execution and delivery by the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers, the Swing Line Lender and the Lenders of this Amendment shall not


be deemed to create a course of dealing or an obligation to execute similar waivers or amendments under the same or similar circumstances in the future.

(b)    The Company, as the guarantor party to the Company Guaranty, confirms its consent to the Amendment and to the documents and agreements referred to herein, in its capacity as such guarantor. Nothing herein shall in any way limit any of the terms or provisions of the Company Guaranty executed by the Company in the Administrative Agent’s, the L/C Issuers’, the Swing Line Lender’s and the Lenders’ favor, or any other Loan Document executed by the Company (as the same may be amended from time to time), all of which are hereby ratified and affirmed by the Company, in such capacity, in all respects.

(c)    This Amendment shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted by the Credit Agreement.

(d)    THIS AMENDMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

(e)    This Amendment may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Amendment and the other Amendment Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4, this Amendment shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Amendment by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Amendment.

(f)    This Amendment and the other Amendment Documents contain the entire and exclusive agreement of the parties hereto with reference to the matters discussed herein. This Amendment supersedes all prior drafts and communications with respect hereto. This Amendment may not be amended except in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.01 of the Credit Agreement.

(g)    If any provision of this Amendment or the other Amendment Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (i) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Amendment and the other Amendment Documents and Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (ii) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

(h)    The Borrowers agree to pay or reimburse all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and MLPFS (including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent and MLPFS), in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery and administration of this Amendment and the other Amendment Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated).

(i)
This Amendment shall constitute a Loan Document.
