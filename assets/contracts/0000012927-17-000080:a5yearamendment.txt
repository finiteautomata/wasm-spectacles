“S&P” means S&P Global Ratings, a division of S&P Global, Inc.
(b)Section 2.2(a) is amended by deleting the time “11:00 a.m.” and substituting therefor the time “1:00 p.m.”

(d)    Failure by TBC to pay when due (i) any obligation for the payment of borrowed money on any regularly scheduled payment date or following acceleration thereof or (ii) any other monetary obligation if, in the case of either of clauses (i) or (ii), the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the obligations with respect to which such failure to pay or acceleration occurred (excluding any failure to pay that TBC certifies is a result of the application of Sanctions) equals or exceeds $500,000,000 and such failure is not remedied within 5 Business Days after TBC receives notice thereof from the Agent or the creditor on such obligation;
(h)Section 6.1(e) is amended (i) by deleting the figure “$150,000,000” in each place such figure appears and substituting therefor the figure “$500,000,000” and (ii) replacing in clause (1)(B) the phrase “reportable event within the meaning of ERISA” with the phrase “reportable event as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA”.
(i)A new Section 7.10 is added at the end of Article 7 to read as follows:
7.10    Lender ERISA Representation.

(b)    This Amendment and the Credit Agreement, as amended hereby, constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of TBC, enforceable against TBC in accordance with their respective terms, subject to general equitable principles and except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws of general application relating to creditors’ rights.

(b)The Credit Agreement and the Notes, as specifically amended by this Amendment, are and shall continue to be in full force and effect and are hereby in all respects ratified and confirmed.
(c)The execution, delivery and effectiveness of this Amendment shall not, except as expressly provided herein, operate as a waiver of any right, power or remedy of any Lender or the Agent under the Credit Agreement, nor constitute a waiver of any provision of the Credit Agreement.
Section 6. Costs and Expenses. TBC agrees to pay upon written request all reasonable costs and expenses of the Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery and administration of this Amendment and the other instruments and documents to be delivered hereunder (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of counsel for the Agent) in accordance with the terms of Section 8.3(a) of the Credit Agreement.

Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Amendment by telecopier shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Amendment.
