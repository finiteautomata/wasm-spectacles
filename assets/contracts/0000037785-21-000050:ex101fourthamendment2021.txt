(ii) The U.S. Borrower may request an increase in the aggregate amount of the Commitments by delivering to the Administrative Agent a notice (an “Increase Notice”, the date of delivery thereof to the Administrative Agent being the “Increase Notice Date”) specifying (1) the Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase, (2) the proposed date (the “Increase Date”) on which the Commitments would be so increased (which Increase Date may not be fewer than 30 nor more than 60 days after the Increase Notice Date) and (3) the New Lenders, if any, to whom the U.S. Borrower desires to offer the opportunity to commit to all or a portion of the Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase and which New Lenders, if any, the U.S. Borrower desires the opportunity to commit to all or a portion of the Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase that would increase the Swing Loan Commitments. The Administrative Agent shall in turn promptly notify each Lender of the U.S. Borrower’s request by sending each Lender a copy of such notice. (iii) Not later than the date that is five days after the Increase Notice Date, the Administrative Agent shall notify each New Lender, if any, identified in the related Increase Notice of the opportunity to commit to all or any portion of the Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase. Each such New Lender may irrevocably commit to all or a portion of the Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase, representing Revolving Commitments, and Swing Loan Commitments, as applicable (such New Lender’s “Proposed New Commitment”) by notifying the Administrative Agent (which shall give prompt notice thereof to the U.S. Borrower) before 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date that is 10 days after the Increase Notice Date; provided that: (A) the Proposed New Commitment of each New Lender shall be in an aggregate amount not less than $10,000,000; and (B) each New Lender that submits a Proposed New Commitment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent (for its acceptance and recording in the Register) a New Commitment Acceptance in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.07 hereof. (iv) If the aggregate Proposed New Commitments of all of the New Lenders shall be less than the Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase, then (unless the U.S. Borrower otherwise requests) the Administrative Agent shall, on or prior to the date that is 15 days after the Increase Notice Date, notify each Lender of (x) the opportunity to so commit to all or any portion of the Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase not committed to by New Lenders pursuant to Section 2.06(b)(iii) and (y) the then-current Final Termination Date. Each Lender may, if, in its sole discretion, it elects to do so, irrevocably offer to commit to all or a portion of such remainder, representing Revolving Commitments and Swing Loan Commitments, as applicable (such Lender’s
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 41 “Proposed Increased Commitment”), by notifying the Administrative Agent (which shall give prompt notice thereof to the U.S. Borrower) no later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date five days before the Increase Date. In no event shall any Lender be obligated to increase its Commitments hereunder. (v) If the aggregate amount of Proposed New Commitments and Proposed Increased Commitments (such aggregate amount, the “Total Committed Increase”) equals or exceeds $25,000,000, then, subject to the conditions set forth in Section 2.06(b)(i): (A) effective on and as of the Increase Date, the Total Commitments shall be increased by the Total Committed Increase (provided that the aggregate amount of the Commitments shall in no event be increased pursuant to this Section 2.06(b) to more than $2,250,000,000 less the amount of any reductions of the Total Commitments under Section 2.06(a)(i)) and shall be allocated among the New Lenders and the Lenders as provided in Section 2.06(b)(vi); (B) effective on and as of the Increase Date, the Termination Date of each New Lender that offers a Proposed New Commitment and of each Increasing Lender shall be changed to the Final Termination Date (notwithstanding any earlier Termination Date for such Lender which may then be in effect pursuant to Section 2.15); and (C) on the Increase Date, if any Revolving Loans are then outstanding, the Borrowers shall borrow Revolving Loans from all or certain of the Lenders and/or (subject to compliance by the U.S. Borrower with Section 9.04(c)) prepay Revolving Loans of all or certain of the Lenders (other than any Defaulting Lender) such that, after giving effect thereto, the Revolving Loans (including, without limitation, the Types, Currencies and Interest Periods thereof) shall be held by the Lenders (including for such purposes New Lenders) ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments (subject, however, to Section 2.09(d)). If the Total Committed Increase is less than $25,000,000, then the Total Commitments shall not be changed. (vi) The Total Committed Increase shall be allocated among New Lenders having Proposed New Commitments and Lenders having Proposed Increased Commitments as follows: (A) If the Total Committed Increase shall be at least $25,000,000 and less than or equal to the Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase, then (x) the initial Commitment of each New Lender shall be such New Lender’s Proposed New Commitment and (y) the Commitment of each Lender shall be increased by such Lender’s Proposed Increased Commitment. (B) If the Total Committed Increase shall be greater than the Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase, then the Total Committed Increase shall be allocated:
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 42 (1) first to New Lenders (to the extent of their respective Proposed New Commitments) in such a manner as the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall agree; and (2) then to Lenders (to the extent of their respective Proposed Increased Commitments, if any) in such a manner as the U.S. Borrower shall determine in its sole discretion upon consultation with the Administrative Agent and the Syndication Agent. (vii) No increase in the Commitments contemplated hereby shall become effective until the Administrative Agent shall have received (x) Revolving Loan Notes payable by each of the Borrowers to each New Lender and each Increasing Lender, to the extent requested, and (y) evidence satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (including an update of paragraphs 2 and 4 of the opinion of counsel provided pursuant to Section 4.01(a)(v) that such increases in the Commitments, and Borrowings thereunder, have been duly authorized. SECTION 2.07. Repayment. (a) Revolving Loans. Subject to Section 2.16(a), each Borrower shall repay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the principal amount of each Revolving Loan made by such Lender to such Borrower, and each Revolving Loan made by such Lender shall mature on the Termination Date of such Lender. (b) [Intentionally Deleted]. (c) Swing Loans. The Swing Loan Borrower shall repay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Swing Loan Lender, the outstanding principal amount of each Swing Loan to the Swing Loan Borrower on the earlier of (i) the maturity date specified in the applicable Swing Loan Request (which maturity shall be no later than the tenth Business Day after the requested date of such Borrowing) and (ii) the Termination Date of such Swing Loan Lender. (d) Letter of Credit Loans. The Letters of Credit shall be repaid as set forth in Section 3.04. (e) Certain Prepayments. (i) If, as of the last Business Day of any week during the period from the Effective Date until the Final Termination Date, (1) the sum of (x) the aggregate amount of all Loans (for which purpose the amount of any Loan that is denominated in an Alternate Currency shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent thereof) plus (y) the Available Amount of all Letters of Credit (for which purpose the Available Amount of any Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternate Currency shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent thereof as of the date of determination) exceeds (2) 103% of the then Total Commitments, the Administrative Agent shall use all reasonable efforts to give prompt written notice thereof to the U.S. Borrower, specifying the amount to be prepaid under this clause (i), and the Borrowers shall, within two Business Days of the date of such notice, prepay the Loans in an amount so that after giving effect thereto the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans (determined as aforesaid) plus the
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 43 Available Amount of all Letters of Credit (determined as aforesaid) does not exceed the Total Commitments; provided that any such payment shall be accompanied by any amounts payable under Section 9.04(c). (ii) [Reserved]. (iii) In addition, if on the last day of any Interest Period the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans (after giving effect to any Loans being made to repay Loans maturing on that date) (for which purpose the amount of any Loan that is denominated in an Alternate Currency shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent thereof) plus the Available Amount of all Letters of Credit (for which purpose the Available Amount of any Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternate Currency shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent thereof as of the date of determination) would exceed 100% of the then Total Commitments, the Administrative Agent shall use all reasonable efforts to give prompt written notice thereof to the U.S. Borrower, specifying the amount to be prepaid under this clause (iii), and the Borrowers shall, within two Business Days of the date of such notice, prepay the Loans, or cause Loans to be prepaid, or reduce the requested Loans in such amounts that after giving effect to such action the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans (after giving effect to any Loans being made to repay Loans maturing on that date) (determined as aforesaid) plus the Available Amount of all Letters of Credit (determined as aforesaid) does not exceed the Total Commitments; provided that any such payment shall be accompanied by any amounts payable under Section 9.04(c). (iv) The determinations of the Administrative Agent under this Section 2.07(e) shall be conclusive and binding on the U.S. Borrower and the other Borrowers in the absence of manifest error. (f) If any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender shall be deemed to have assigned any and all payments in respect of the Obligations due to it from or for the benefit of any Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.07 to the Non-Defaulting Lenders for application to, and reduction of, their ratable portion of all Obligations until such Non-Defaulting Lenders have been repaid in full. Such Defaulting Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to distribute such payments in accordance with Section 2.16(a)(iii). This Section 2.07 shall (i) apply and be effective regardless of whether an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and notwithstanding (1) any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary or (2) any instruction of the U.S. Borrower as to its desired application of payments and (ii) not be deemed to relieve or otherwise release any Borrower from any of its Obligations due or owing to any Lender, including a Defaulting Lender. SECTION 2.08. Interest. (a) Ordinary Interest. Each Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Loan made by each Lender to such Borrower, from the date of such Loan until such principal amount shall be paid in full, at the following rates per annum and in each case subject to Section 2.16(a)(iii): (i) Base Rate Loans and Letter of Credit Loans. If such Loan is either a Revolving Loan or a Letter of Credit Loan which, in each case, bears interest at the Base Rate, a rate per annum equal at all times to the Base Rate in effect from time to
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 44 time plus the Applicable Margin, payable on (A) each Quarterly Date while such Base Rate Loan is outstanding or (B) the last day of each month during which such Letter of Credit Loan is outstanding, and in each case, on the date such Base Rate Loan or Letter of Credit Loan shall be paid in full. (ii) Swing Loans. If such Loan is a Swing Loan (other than an Overdraft Advance, for which the rate shall be equal to the Overdraft Advance Interest Rate), a rate per annum equal at all times to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin (applicable to Base Rate Loans) in effect from time to time, payable (A) on the first Business Day of each calendar quarter, commencing on the first such day following the making of such Swing Loan, (B) upon each payment or prepayment thereof in full or in part and (C) if not previously paid in full, at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) of such Swing Loan. (iii) Eurocurrency Rate Loans. If such Loan is a Eurocurrency Rate Loan, a rate per annum equal at all times during each Interest Period for such Loan to the sum of the applicable Eurocurrency Rate with respect to such Loan for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin, payable on the last day of such Interest Period and, if such Interest Period has a duration of more than three months, at three-month intervals following the first day of such Interest Period. (b) Default Interest. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default that has not been waived, the Administrative Agent may, and upon the request of the Required Lenders shall, require the Borrowers to pay to the fullest extent permitted by law interest (“Default Interest”) on all outstanding Obligations at the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans plus two percentage points (2%) per annum; provided however, that following the acceleration of the Loans and other Obligations pursuant to Section 7.01, Default Interest shall accrue and be payable hereunder whether or not previously required by the Administrative Agent. SECTION 2.09. Interest Rate Determinations. (a) [Intentionally Deleted]. (b) The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the U.S. Borrower and the Lenders of the applicable interest rate determined by the Administrative Agent for purposes of Section 2.08(a)(i), (ii) and (iii). (c) Subject to Section 2.18, if prior to 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on any date on which an interest rate is to be determined pursuant to the definition of “Eurocurrency Rate”, (i) the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding on the U.S. Borrower) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan, or (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Required Lenders in respect of the relevant facility that the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Eurocurrency Rate Loan for such Interest Period, then the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the U.S. Borrower and each Lender of such circumstances, whereupon the right of the Borrowers to select Eurocurrency Rate Loans for any requested Revolving Loan Borrowing or any subsequent Revolving Loan Borrowing shall be suspended until the first date on which the circumstances causing such
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 45 suspension cease to exist. If the Borrowers shall not, in turn, before 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on such date notify the Administrative Agent that a Notice of Revolving Loan Borrowing with respect to such Eurocurrency Rate shall be converted to a Notice of Revolving Loan Borrowing for a Eurocurrency Rate Loan in a different Currency or a Base Rate Loan, such Notice of Revolving Loan Borrowing shall be deemed to be canceled and of no force or effect, and the U.S. Borrower shall not be liable to the Administrative Agent or any Lender with respect thereto except as set forth in Section 3.01(c). In the event of such a suspension, the Administrative Agent shall review the circumstances giving rise to such suspension at least weekly and shall notify the U.S. Borrower and the Lenders promptly of the end of such suspension, and thereafter the Borrowers shall be entitled, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, to borrow Eurocurrency Rate Loans and Swing Loans in such Currency. (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Lender whose Termination Date falls prior to the last day of any Interest Period for any Eurocurrency Rate Loan (a “Relevant Lender”) shall participate in such Loan. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Relevant Lender shall (i) participate in a Borrowing of any Eurocurrency Rate Loan having an initial Interest Period ending after such Lender’s Termination Date, (ii) have any outstanding Eurocurrency Rate Loan continued for a subsequent Interest Period if such subsequent Interest Period would end after such Lender’s Termination Date or (iii) have any outstanding Base Rate Loan Converted into a Eurocurrency Rate Loan if such Eurocurrency Rate Loan would have an initial Interest Period ending after such Lender’s Termination Date. If any Relevant Lender has outstanding a Eurocurrency Rate Loan that cannot be continued for a subsequent Interest Period pursuant to clause (ii) above or has outstanding a Base Rate Loan that cannot be Converted into a Eurocurrency Rate Loan pursuant to clause (iii) above, such Lender’s ratable share of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan (in the case of said clause (ii)) shall be repaid by the relevant Borrower on the last day of its then current Interest Period and such Lender’s ratable share of such Base Rate Loan (in the case of said clause (iii)) shall be repaid by the relevant Borrower on the day on which the Loans of Lenders unaffected by said clause (iii) are so Converted. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Borrowers may fund the repayment of the Relevant Lenders’ ratable shares of such Eurocurrency Rate Loans and Base Rate Loans by borrowing from Lenders hereunder that are not Relevant Lenders. SECTION 2.10. Prepayments. (a) The Borrowers shall have no right to prepay any principal amount of any Revolving Loan or Swing Loan other than as provided in subsection (b) below. (b) Each Borrower may without premium or penalty, (i) upon at least the number of Business Days’ prior notice specified in the first sentence of Section 3.01(a) with respect to any Revolving Loan of the same Type, (ii) upon notice by no later than 11:00 AM (London time) one Business Day prior to the date of prepayment of any Swing Loan in any case given to the Administrative Agent stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment, and if such notice is given, such Borrower shall, prepay the outstanding principal amounts of the Loans made to such Borrower comprising part of the same Revolving Loan Borrowing or Swing Loan Borrowing, as the case may be, in whole or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid; provided however, that (x) each partial prepayment (other than any prepayment of any Swing Loan) shall be in an aggregate principal amount not less than $1,000,000 or an integral multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof (or the Foreign Currency Equivalent of such respective amounts in the case of
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 46 Loans denominated in an Alternate Currency) and (y) if any prepayment of any Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be made on a date which is not the last day of an Interest Period for such Loans (or on a date which is not the maturity date of such Swing Loans), such Borrower shall also pay any amounts owing to each Lender pursuant to Section 9.04(c) so long as such Lender makes written demand upon such Borrower therefor (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent) within 20 Business Days after such prepayment. SECTION 2.11. Payments and Computations. (a) All payments of principal of and interest on each Loan in a particular Currency shall be made in such Currency. (b) (i) All payments of principal of and interest on the Loans and all other amounts whatsoever payable by a Borrower under this Agreement and the Notes shall be made in immediately available funds, without deduction, setoff or counterclaim, to the Administrative Agent’s Account for the relevant Currency, not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) (in the case of amounts payable in Dollars) or 11:00 A.M. Local Time in the location of the Administrative Agent’s Account (in the case of amounts payable in an Alternate Currency), on the day when due. (ii) The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest or fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.09(d), 2.12, 2.15(c) or 3.05 or as contemplated by Section 2.05(c) or 2.16) to the Lenders entitled thereto for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (iii) Upon its acceptance of an Acceptance and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 9.07(d), from and after the effective date specified in such Acceptance the Administrative Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under the Notes in respect of the interest assigned or assumed thereby to the Lender assignee or New Lender thereunder (as the case may be). The parties to each Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves. (c) All computations of interest based on the Base Rate (other than if the Base Rate is computed on the basis of the Federal Funds Rate) and of facility fees and letter of credit commission shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based on the Eurocurrency Rate, the Swing Loan Rate or the Base Rate based on the Federal Funds Rate shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or fees are payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (d) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 47 payment of interest, facility fee or, letter of credit commission, as the case may be; provided however, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurocurrency Rate Loans to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day. (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each relevant Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent that such Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate. (f) Anything in Section 2.11(a) to the contrary notwithstanding, and without prejudice to Section 2.08(b) or 7.01(a), if any Borrower shall fail to pay any principal or interest denominated in an Alternate Currency within one Business Day after the due date therefor in the case of principal and three Business Days after the due date therefor in the case of interest (without giving effect to any acceleration of maturity under Article VII (Events of Default)), the amount so in default shall automatically be redenominated in Dollars on the day one Business Day after the due date therefor in the case of a principal payment and three Business Days after the due date therefor in the case of an interest payment in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such principal or interest. (g) If any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender shall be deemed to have assigned any and all payments in respect of the Obligations subject to this Section 2.11 due to it from and for the benefit of the Borrowers to the Non-Defaulting Lenders for application to, and reduction of, the Non-Defaulting Lenders’ ratable portion of all Obligations until such Non-Defaulting Lenders have been repaid in full. Each Defaulting Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to distribute such payments in accordance with Section 2.16(a)(iii). This Section 2.11(g) shall (i) apply at any time such Lender is a Defaulting Lender and be effective regardless of whether an Event of Default has occurred or is continuing and notwithstanding (1) any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary or (2) any instruction of the U.S. Borrower as to its desired application of payments and (ii) not be deemed to relieve or otherwise release any Borrower from any of its Obligations due or owing to any Lender, including a Defaulting Lender. SECTION 2.12. Taxes. (a) Defined Terms. For purposes of this Section, the term “Lender” includes any Issuing Bank and the term “Applicable Law” includes FATCA. (b) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrowers under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by Applicable Law. If any Applicable Law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 48 applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the Borrowers shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. (c) Payment of Other Taxes by Borrower. The Borrowers shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. (d) Indemnification by Borrower. The Borrowers shall indemnify each Recipient for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority, provided, however, that (i) no Borrower shall be liable to any Person, as the case may be, for any liability arising from or with respect to Indemnified Taxes, which results from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Recipient, (ii) so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such Recipient shall use its reasonable best efforts (all at the expense of such Borrower) to cooperate with each Borrower in contesting any Taxes or Other Taxes which such Borrower reasonably deems to be not correctly or legally asserted or otherwise not due and owing and (iii) no Borrower shall be liable to such Recipient for any such liability if such Person fails to make written demand for indemnification therefor within 120 days of receiving notice of the existence of such liability. This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Recipient makes written demand therefor. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Borrower or any Person. (e) Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrowers have not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrowers to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.07(f) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (e). (f) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by the Borrowers to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section, the Borrowers shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 49 such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. (g) Status of Lenders. (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to any relevant Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the relevant Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable such Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in paragraphs (g)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) of this Section) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, with respect to the U.S. Borrower, (A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or about the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the U.S. Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or about the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the U.S. Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: (1) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty; (2) executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 50 (3) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the U.S. Borrower within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” related to the U.S. Borrower as described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E; or (4) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-2 or Exhibit F-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or about the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of such Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by Applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by Applicable Law to permit the U.S. Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and (D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the U.S. Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by Applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the U.S. Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 51 payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. (iii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, with respect to any Borrower that is not a U.S. Person, any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or about the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of such Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by Applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in applicable withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by Applicable Law to permit the applicable Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made. Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. For purposes of determining withholding taxes imposed under FATCA, the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall treat (and the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to treat) the Agreement as not qualifying as a “grandfathered obligation” within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1471-2(b)(2)(i)(A). (h) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (h) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (h), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (h) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. (i) Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 52 that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. (j) If a Borrower is required to pay any Lender any Taxes under Section 2.12(b) or (d), such Lender shall be an “Affected Person”, and the U.S. Borrower shall have the rights set forth in Section 3.08 to replace such Affected Person. (k) Survival. Each party’s obligations under this Section shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document. SECTION 2.13. Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Revolving Loans, the Swing Loans or the Letter of Credit Loans made by it (other than as expressly provided herein) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Revolving Loans, the Swing Loans or the Letter of Credit Loans obtained by all such Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from such other Lenders such participations in the Revolving Loans, the Swing Loans or the Letter of Credit Loans made by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them, provided however, that, if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and each Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.13 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation. SECTION 2.14. Conversion or Continuation of Revolving Loans. (a) Each Borrower may elect (i) at any time on any Business Day to Convert Base Rate Loans or any portion thereof to Eurocurrency Rate Loans or (ii) at the end of any applicable Interest Period, to Convert Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars or any portion thereof into Base Rate Loans or to Continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans or any portion thereof for an additional Interest Period; provided however, that the aggregate amount of the Eurocurrency Rate Loans Converted or Continued for each Interest Period must be in the amount of at least $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Each Conversion or Continuation shall be allocated among the Revolving Loans of each Lender in accordance with such Lender’s pro rata share. Subject to clause (b) below, each such election shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit B-2 (Form of Notice of Conversion or Continuation) (a “Notice of Conversion or Continuation”) and shall be made by giving the Administrative Agent (x) in the case of a Continuation or Conversion into Eurocurrency Rate Loans, at least three Business Days’ prior written notice, and (y) in the case of a Conversion into Base Rate Loans, at least one Business Day’s prior written notice, in each case, specifying (A) the amount and Type of Revolving Loan being Converted or Continued, (B) in the case of a Conversion to or a Continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, the applicable Interest Period and (C) in the case of a
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 53 Conversion, the date of Conversion (which date shall be a Business Day and, if a Conversion from Eurocurrency Rate Loans, shall also be the last day of the applicable Interest Period). (b) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of a Notice of Conversion or Continuation and of the options selected therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Conversion in whole or in part of Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Rate Loans, and no Continuation in whole or in part of Eurocurrency Rate Loans upon the expiration of any applicable Interest Period, shall be permitted at any time at which (A) a Default or an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or (B) the Continuation of, or Conversion into, a Eurocurrency Rate Loan would violate any provision of Section 2.09, 3.05 or 3.06. If, within the time period required under the terms of this Section 2.14, the Administrative Agent does not receive a Notice of Conversion or Continuation from the applicable Borrower containing a permitted election to Continue any Eurocurrency Rate Loans for an additional Interest Period or to Convert any such Revolving Loans, then, upon the expiration of the applicable Interest Period, such Revolving Loans, if denominated in Dollars, shall be automatically Converted to Base Rate Loans and such Revolving Loans, if denominated in Euros, shall be automatically Continued as Eurocurrency Rate Loans with an interest period of one month (or if consented to by all Lenders, seven days). Each Notice of Conversion or Continuation shall be irrevocable. (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall, upon the expiration of the applicable Interest Period, be automatically Converted to a Base Rate Loan. SECTION 2.15. Extension of Termination Date. (a) The U.S. Borrower may, by notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders) not less than 40 days and not more than 60 days prior to each of the first and second anniversaries of the Effective Date (each anniversary, an “Anniversary Date”), request that each Lender extend such Lender’s Termination Date to the date (the “New Termination Date”) that is one year after the then Final Termination Date; provided that the representations and warranties contained in Article V (Representations and Warranties) shall be correct in all material respects (except any representations and warranties that are qualified by materiality, which shall be true and correct in all respects) as of the date of such request, as though made on and as of such date, other than any such representations or warranties that, by their terms, refer to a different date, which shall be true and correct as of such earlier date. Each Lender, acting in its sole discretion, shall, by written notice to the Administrative Agent given no later than the date (the “Consent Date”) that is 20 days prior to the relevant Anniversary Date (provided that, if such date is not a Business Day, the Consent Date shall be the next succeeding Business Day), advise the Administrative Agent as to: (i) whether or not such Lender agrees to such extension of its Termination Date (each Lender so agreeing to such extension being an “Extending Lender”); and (ii) only if such Lender is an Extending Lender, whether or not such Lender also irrevocably offers to increase the amount of its Commitment (each Lender so offering to increase its Commitment being an “Increasing Lender” as well as an Extending Lender) and, if so, the amount of the additional Commitment such Lender so
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 54 irrevocably offers to assume hereunder (such Lender’s “Proposed Additional Commitment”). Each Lender that determines not to extend its Termination Date (a “Non-Extending Lender”) shall notify the Administrative Agent (which shall notify the Lenders) of such fact promptly after such determination but in any event no later than the Consent Date, and any Lender that does not advise the Administrative Agent in writing on or before the Consent Date shall be deemed to be a Non-Extending Lender and (without limiting the U.S. Borrower’s rights under Section 2.15(c)) shall have no liability to the U.S. Borrower in connection therewith. The election of any Lender to agree to such extension shall not obligate any other Lender to so agree. The Administrative Agent shall notify the U.S. Borrower of each Lender’s determination under this Section 2.15(a) no later than the date 15 days prior to the relevant Anniversary Date (or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the next preceding Business Day). (b) (i) If all of the Lenders are Extending Lenders, then, effective as of the Consent Date, the Termination Date of each Lender shall be extended to the New Termination Date, and the respective Commitments of the Lenders will not be subject to change at such Consent Date pursuant to this Section 2.15. (ii) If and only if the sum of (x) the aggregate amount of the Commitments of the Extending Lenders plus (y) the aggregate amount of the Proposed Additional Commitments of the Increasing Lenders (such sum, the “Extending Commitments”) shall be equal to at least 50% of the then Total Commitments, then: (A) effective as of the Consent Date, the Termination Date of each Extending Lender shall be extended to the New Termination Date; (B) the U.S. Borrower shall (so long as no Default shall have occurred and be continuing) have the right, but not the obligation, to take either of the following actions with respect to each Non-Extending Lender during the period commencing on the Consent Date and ending on the immediately succeeding Anniversary Date: (1) the U.S. Borrower may elect by notice to the Administrative Agent and such Non-Extending Lender that the Termination Date of such Non-Extending Lender be changed to a date (which date shall be specified in such notice) on or prior to such immediately succeeding Anniversary Date (and, upon the giving of such notice, the Termination Date of such Non-Extending Lender shall be so changed); or (2) the U.S. Borrower may replace such Non- Extending Lender as a party to this Agreement in accordance with Section 2.15(c); and (C) the Administrative Agent shall notify the Issuing Banks and the Swing Loan Lenders of the New Termination Date and the Lenders whose Termination Dates are the New Termination Date and each Issuing Bank and each Swing Loan Lender shall determine whether or not, acting in its sole discretion, it shall elect to extend its Termination Date to the New Termination Date and shall so
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 55 notify the Administrative Agent. If such Issuing Bank or such Swing Loan Lender, as the case may be, has elected to so extend its Termination Date, then such Issuing Bank’s obligation to issue Letters of Credit pursuant to Sections 2.04 and 3.04 shall be extended to the date that is 30 days prior to the New Termination Date and/or such Swing Loan Lender’s obligation to make Swing Loans to the Borrowers pursuant to Sections 2.03 and 3.03 shall be extended to the date that is 15 Business Days prior to the New Termination Date. (iii) If neither of the conditions specified in clause (i) or clause (ii) of this Section 2.15(b) is satisfied, then neither the Termination Date nor the Commitment of any Lender will change pursuant to this Section 2.15 on such Consent Date, and the U.S. Borrower will not have the right to take any of the actions specified in Section 2.06(b)(ii). (c) Replacement by the U.S. Borrower of Non-Extending Lenders pursuant to Section 2.15(b)(ii)(B)(2) shall be effected as follows (certain terms being used in this Section 2.15(c) having the meanings assigned to them in Section 2.15(d)) on the relevant Assignment Date: (i) the Assignors shall severally assign and transfer to the Assignees, and the Assignees shall severally purchase and assume from the Assignors, all of the Assignors’ rights and obligations (including, without limitation, the Assignors’ respective Commitments) hereunder and under the Notes; (ii) each Assignee shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for account of the Assignors, an amount equal to such Assignee’s Share of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans then held by the Assignors; (iii) the U.S. Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for account of the Assignors, all accrued interest, fees and other amounts (other than principal of outstanding Loans) then due and owing to the Assignors by the U.S. Borrower hereunder (including, without limitation, payments due such Assignors, if any, under Sections 2.12, 3.05 and 9.04(c)); and (iv) the U.S. Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for account of the Administrative Agent the $3,500 processing and recordation fee for each assignment effected pursuant to this Section 2.15(c). The assignments provided for in this Section 2.15(c) shall be effected on the relevant Assignment Date in accordance with Section 9.07 and pursuant to one or more Assignments and Acceptances. After giving effect to such assignments, each Assignee shall have a Commitment hereunder (which, if such Assignee was a Lender hereunder immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment, shall be in addition to such Assignee’s existing Commitment) in an amount equal to the amount of its Assumed Commitment representing a Commitment. Upon any such termination or assignment, such Assignor shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be obligated under Section 8.05 and be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.04, as well as to any fees and other amounts accrued for its account under Section 2.05, 2.12 or 3.05 and not yet paid.
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 56 (d) For purposes of this Section 2.15, the following terms shall have the following meanings (such meanings to be equally applicable to both the singular and plural forms of the terms defined): “Assigned Commitments” means the Commitments of Non-Extending Lenders to be replaced pursuant to Section 2.15(b)(ii)(B)(2). “Assignees” means, at any time, Increasing Lenders and, if the Assigned Commitments exceed the aggregate amount of the Proposed Additional Commitments, one or more New Lenders. “Assignment Date” means the Anniversary Date or such earlier date as shall be acceptable to the U.S. Borrower, the relevant Assignors, the relevant Assignees and the Administrative Agent. “Assignors” means, at any time, the Lenders to be replaced by the U.S. Borrower pursuant to Section 2.15(b)(ii)(B)(2). The “Assumed Commitment” of each Assignee shall be determined as follows: (a) If the aggregate amount of the Proposed Additional Commitments of all of the Increasing Lenders shall exceed the aggregate amount of the Assigned Commitments, then (i) the amount of the Assumed Commitment of each Increasing Lender shall be equal to (x) the aggregate amount of the Assigned Commitments multiplied by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to such Increasing Lender’s Commitment as then in effect and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of the Commitments of all Increasing Lenders as then in effect; and (ii) no New Lender shall become a Lender hereunder pursuant to Section 2.15(c). (b) If the aggregate amount of the Proposed Additional Commitments of all of the Increasing Lenders shall be less than or equal to the aggregate amount of the Assigned Commitments, then: (i) the amount of the Assumed Commitment of each Increasing Lender shall be equal to such Increasing Lender’s Proposed Additional Commitment; and (ii) the excess, if any, of the aggregate amount of the Assigned Commitments over the aggregate amount of the Proposed Additional Commitments shall be allocated among New Lenders in such a manner as the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent may agree. “Share” means, as to any Assignee, a fraction the numerator of which is equal to such Assignee’s Assumed Commitment and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of the Assumed Commitments of all the Assignees. SECTION 2.16. Defaulting Lender. (a) Reallocation of Defaulting Lender Commitments. If a Lender becomes, and during the period it remains, a Defaulting Lender, the following provisions shall apply:
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 57 (i) in the case of each Defaulting Lender, the ratable portion of such Defaulting Lender with respect to any such outstanding Obligations will, subject to the limitation in the first proviso below, automatically be reallocated (effective on the date such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender) among the Lenders that are Non-Defaulting Lenders pro rata in accordance with such Non-Defaulting Lenders’ respective Commitments; provided that (A) the sum of each Non-Defaulting Lender’s ratable portion of the Total Outstandings may not in any event exceed the Commitment of such Non-Defaulting Lender as in effect at the time of such reallocation and (B) neither such reallocation nor any payment by a Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant thereto will constitute a waiver or release of any claim any Borrower, the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank, any Swing Loan Lender or any other Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender, or cause such Defaulting Lender to be a Non-Defaulting Lender; (ii) in the case of each Defaulting Lender, to the extent that any portion (the “unreallocated portion”) of the ratable portion of such Defaulting Lender with respect to any such outstanding and future Letter of Credit Obligations and Swing Loans cannot be so reallocated, whether by reason of clause (A) of the proviso in clause (i) above or otherwise, the U.S. Borrower will, not later than 5 Business Days after demand by the Administrative Agent (at the direction of the Issuing Banks and/or the Swing Loan Lenders, as the case may be), (A) Cash Collateralize (pursuant to procedures similar to those detailed in Section 7.02 and reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent) the Obligations of the Borrowers to the Issuing Banks and the Swing Loan Lenders in respect of such Obligations or (B) make other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, and to the Issuing Banks and the Swing Loan Lenders, as the case may be, in their reasonable discretion, to protect them against the risk of non-payment by such Defaulting Lender; and (iii) in the case of each Defaulting Lender, any amount paid by the U.S. Borrower for the account of such Defaulting Lender under this Agreement (whether on account of principal, interest, fees, indemnity payments or other amounts) will not be paid or distributed to such Defaulting Lender, but will instead be retained by the Administrative Agent in a segregated, non-interest bearing account until (subject to Section 2.05(c)) the termination of the Commitments and payment in full of all the Obligations and will be applied by the Administrative Agent, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to the making of payments from time to time in the following order of priority: first to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, second to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to any Issuing Bank or any Swing Loan Lender (pro rata as to the respective amounts owing to each of them) under this Agreement, third to the payment of post-default interest and then current interest due and payable to the Lenders hereunder other than Defaulting Lenders as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement as determined in any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, any Issuing Bank or any Swing Loan Lender against such Defaulting Lender, ratably among them in accordance with the amounts of such interest then due and payable to them, fourth to the payment of fees then due and payable to the Non-Defaulting Lenders hereunder as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement as determined in any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, any Issuing Bank or any Swing Loan Lender against such Defaulting Lender, ratably among them in accordance
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 58 with the amounts of such fees then due and payable to them, fifth to pay principal and Reimbursement Obligations in respect of the Letters of Credit at such time then due and payable to the Non-Defaulting Lenders hereunder ratably in accordance with the amounts thereof then due and payable to them, sixth to the ratable payment of other amounts then due and payable to the Non-Defaulting Lenders as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement as determined in any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, any Issuing Bank or any Swing Loan Lender against such Defaulting Lender, seventh after the termination of the Commitments and payment in full of all the Obligations, to pay amounts owing under this Agreement to such Defaulting Lender or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct. (b) Cash Collateral Call. If any Lender becomes, and during the period it remains, a Defaulting Lender, if any Letter of Credit is at the time outstanding, the Issuing Banks may (except, in the case of a Defaulting Lender, to the extent the Commitments have been fully reallocated pursuant to Section 2.16(a)), by notice to the Borrowers and such Defaulting Lender through the Administrative Agent, require any Borrower (i) to deposit in a cash collateral account maintained by the Administrative Agent an amount at least equal to 105% of the aggregate amount of the unreallocated obligations (contingent or otherwise) of such Defaulting Lender to be applied pro rata in respect thereof, or (ii) to make other arrangements satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, and to the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, in their sole discretion to protect them against the risk of non-payment by such Defaulting Lender. (c) Right to Give Drawdown Notices. In furtherance of the foregoing, if any Lender becomes, and during the period it remains, a Defaulting Lender, and the applicable Borrower fails to Cash Collateralize (pursuant to procedures similar to those detailed in Section 7.02 and reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent) or prepay its obligations in respect of Letter of Credit Obligations or Swing Loans within 5 Business Days after demand by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.16, any Issuing Bank or Swing Loan Lender is hereby authorized by the Borrowers (which authorization is irrevocable and coupled with an interest) to give, in its discretion, through the Administrative Agent, Notices of Borrowing pursuant to Section 3.01 in such amounts and in such times as may be required to (i) pay matured Reimbursement Obligations, (ii) repay an outstanding Swing Loan, and/or (iii) Cash Collateralize (pursuant to procedures similar to those detailed in Section 7.02 and reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent) the Obligations of the applicable Borrower in respect of Letters of Credit Obligations or Swing Loans in an amount at least equal to the aggregate amount of the obligations (contingent or otherwise) of such Defaulting Lender in respect of such Letter of Credit or Swing Loan. (d) Termination of Defaulting Lender Commitments. The U.S. Borrower may terminate the unused amount of the Commitment of a Defaulting Lender upon not less than 10 Business Days’ prior notice to the Administrative Agent (who will promptly notify the Lenders thereof), and in such event the provisions of Section 2.11 will apply to all amounts thereafter paid by the U.S. Borrower for the account of such Defaulting Lender under this Agreement (whether on account of principal, interest, fees, indemnity or other amounts); provided that such termination will not be deemed to be a waiver or release of any claim any Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks, the Swing Loan Lenders or any Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender. (e) Cure. If the U.S. Borrower, Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Swing Loan Lenders, as applicable, agree in writing in their discretion that a Lender that is a
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 59 Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, as the case may be, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any amounts then held in the segregated account referred to in Section 2.16(a)), such Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase such portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders and/or make such other adjustments as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause such Lender’s ratable portion to be on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective Commitment, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender and will become a Non-Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrowers while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Non-Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lender having been a Defaulting Lender. (f) Non-Defaulting Lender. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the occurrence of any Lender becoming a Defaulting Lender shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations to make such Loan or payment on any date required under this Agreement and no other Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any Defaulting Lender to make any Loan or payment required under this Agreement. SECTION 2.17. Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial Institutions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding of the parties hereto, each such party acknowledges that any liability of any Affected Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the write-down and conversion powers of the applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by: (a) the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the applicable Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an Affected Financial Institution; and (b) the effects of any Bail-in Action on any such liability, including, if applicable: (i) a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability; (ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such Affected Financial Institution, its parent entity, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or (iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of the applicable Resolution Authority. SECTION 2.18. Benchmark Replacement Setting.
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 60 (a) Benchmark Replacement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred for a currency prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of a then-current Benchmark for such currency, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (a)(iii) or (b) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any such Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. If (i) a Benchmark Replacement Date has occurred for USD LIBOR and the applicable Benchmark Replacement on such Benchmark Replacement Date for USD LIBOR is a Benchmark Replacement other than the sum of: (a) Term SOFR and (b) the related Benchmark Replacement Adjustment, (ii) subsequently, the Relevant Governmental Body recommends for use a forward-looking term rate based on SOFR for loans denominated in Dollars and the Borrower requests that the Administrative Agent review the administrative feasibility of such recommended forward-looking term rate for purposes of this Agreement and (iii) following such request from the Borrower, the Administrative Agent determines (in its sole discretion) that such forward looking term rate is administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent, then the Administrative Agent may (in its sole discretion) provide the Borrower and Lenders with written notice that from and after a date identified in such notice: (i) a Benchmark Replacement Date shall be deemed to have occurred and the Benchmark Replacement on such Benchmark Replacement Date shall be deemed to be a Benchmark Replacement determined in accordance with clause (a)(i) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” under this Section 2.18(a); provided, however, that if upon such Benchmark Replacement Date the Benchmark Replacement Adjustment is unable to be determined in accordance with clause (a)(i) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” and the corresponding definition of “Benchmark Replacement Adjustment”, then the Benchmark Replacement Adjustment in effect immediately prior to such new Benchmark Replacement Date shall be utilized for purposes of this Benchmark Replacement (for avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this proviso, such Benchmark Replacement Adjustment shall be the Benchmark Replacement Adjustment which was established in accordance with the definition of “Benchmark Replacement Adjustment” on the date determined in accordance with clauses (a) or (b), as applicable, of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement Date” hereunder) and (ii) such forward looking term rate shall be deemed to be the forward looking term rate referenced in the definition of “Term SOFR” for all purposes hereunder or under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting and any subsequent Benchmark settings, without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document. For the avoidance of doubt, if the circumstances described in the immediately preceding sentence shall occur, all applicable provisions set forth in this Section titled “Benchmark Replacement Setting” shall apply with respect to such election of the Administrative Agent as completely as if such forward-looking term rate was initially determined in accordance with clause (a)(i) of the
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 61 definition of “Benchmark Replacement”, including, without limitation, the provisions set forth in clauses (b) and (f) of this Section 2.18. (b) Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. In connection with the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document. (c) Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (i) any Benchmark Replacement Date and the related Benchmark Replacement, (ii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, (iii) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to clause (d) below and (iv) the commencement of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. For the avoidance of doubt, any notice required to be delivered by the Administrative Agent as set forth in this Section 2.18 may be provided, at the option of the Administrative Agent (in its sole discretion), in one or more notices and may be delivered together with, or as part of any amendment which implements any Benchmark Replacement or Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 2.18, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.18. (d) Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including Term SOFR or USD LIBOR) and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor. (e) Benchmark Unavailability Period. Upon the Borrower’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to a Benchmark for Dollars, the Borrower may revoke any request for a Eurocurrency Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Loans in Dollars to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 62 converted any such request into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, to the extent a component of Base Rate is based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, such Benchmark or tenor will not be used in any determination of Base Rate. Upon the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to a Benchmark for any currency other than Dollars, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Loans referencing such Benchmark in the affected currency shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Borrowings or Interest Periods). (f) Disclaimer. The Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to (i) the administration, submission or any other matter related to the London interbank offered rate or other rates in the definition of “Eurocurrency Rate” or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof (including, without limitation any Benchmark Replacement implemented hereunder), (ii) the composition or characteristics of any such Benchmark Replacement, including whether it is similar to, or produces the same value or economic equivalence to USD LIBOR or any other then-current Benchmark or have the same volume or liquidity as did USD LIBOR or any other then-current Benchmark, (iii) any actions or use of its discretion or other decisions or determinations made with respect to any matters covered by this Section 2.18 including, without limitation, whether or not a Benchmark Transition Event has occurred, the removal or lack thereof of unavailable or non-representative tenors, the implementation or lack thereof of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, the delivery or non-delivery of any notices required by clause (c) above or otherwise in accordance herewith, and (iv) the effect of any of the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.18. ARTICLE III MAKING THE LOANS AND ISSUING THE LETTERS OF CREDIT SECTION 3.01. Making the Revolving Loans. (a) Each Revolving Loan Borrowing shall be made on notice, given not later than (x) 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan Borrowing, and (y) 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the day of a Base Rate Loan Borrowing, by the U.S. Borrower (on its own behalf and on behalf of any Euro Borrower) to the Administrative Agent, which shall give to each Lender prompt notice thereof. Each notice of a Revolving Loan Borrowing (a “Notice of Revolving Loan Borrowing”) shall be made in writing by telecopier, electronic mail, telex or cable, in substantially the form of Exhibit B-1 hereto, specifying therein the requested (i) date of such Revolving Loan Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), (ii) Currency and Type of Revolving Loan comprising such Revolving Loan Borrowing, (iii) aggregate amount of such Revolving Loan Borrowing, (iv) in the case of a Revolving Loan Borrowing comprised of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, the Interest Period for each such Revolving Loan, and (v) the name of the Borrower (which shall be the U.S. Borrower or a Euro Borrower). Each Lender shall (A) before 11:00 A.M. Local Time on the date of such Borrowing (in the case of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan Borrowing) and (B) before 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date of such Borrowing (in the case of a Base Rate Loan Borrowing), make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent’s Account for the relevant Currency in same day funds, such Lender’s ratable portion of such Borrowing. After the Administrative Agent’s
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 63 receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article IV (Conditions of Lending), the Administrative Agent will make such funds available to the relevant Borrower in such manner as the Administrative Agent and the U.S. Borrower may agree; provided however, that the Administrative Agent shall first make a portion of such funds equal to the aggregate principal amount of any Swing Loan and Letter of Credit Loans as to which a Borrower has received timely notice made by the Swing Loan Lenders or the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, or by any other Lender and outstanding on the date of such Revolving Loan Borrowing, plus interest accrued and unpaid thereon to and as of such date, available to the relevant Swing Loan Lenders or the relevant Issuing Banks, as the case may be, and such other Lenders for repayment of such Swing Loans and Letter of Credit Loans. (b) Anything in subsection (a) above to the contrary notwithstanding, the U.S. Borrower may not select Eurocurrency Rate Loans for any Revolving Loan Borrowing if the aggregate amount of such Revolving Loan Borrowing is less than $1,000,000 or the Foreign Currency Equivalent thereof. (c) Subject to Sections 2.09(c) and 3.06, each Notice of Revolving Loan Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the U.S. Borrower and the relevant Borrower. In the case of any Revolving Loan Borrowing by a Borrower which the related Notice of Revolving Loan Borrowing specifies is to be comprised of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, such Borrower shall indemnify each relevant Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the date specified in such Notice of Revolving Loan Borrowing for such Revolving Loan Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article IV (Conditions of Lending), including, without limitation, any loss (excluding loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the Revolving Loan to be made by such Lender as part of such Revolving Loan Borrowing when such Revolving Loan, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date. (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the time any Revolving Loan Borrowing is required to be made that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s ratable portion of such Revolving Loan Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Revolving Loan Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 3.01 and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the relevant Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the relevant Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to such Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to Revolving Loans comprising such Revolving Loan Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate, provided that such Borrower retains its rights against such Lender with respect to any damages it may incur as a result of such Lender’s failure to fund, and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall such Borrower be liable to such Lender or any other Person for the interest payable by such Lender to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this sentence. If such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 64 constitute such Lender’s Revolving Loan as part of such Revolving Loan Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement. (e) The failure of any Lender to make the Revolving Loan to be made by it as part of any Revolving Loan Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Revolving Loan on the date of such Revolving Loan Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Revolving Loan to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Revolving Loan Borrowing. SECTION 3.02. [Intentionally Deleted]. SECTION 3.03. Making the Swing Loans, Etc. (a) In order to request a Swing Loan, the Swing Loan Borrower shall telecopy (or forward by electronic mail or similar means) to the applicable Swing Loan Lender, with a copy to the Administrative Agent, a duly completed request in substantially the form of Exhibit E (Form of Swing Loan Request), setting forth the requested amount, currency and date of such Swing Loan (a “Swing Loan Request”), to be received by the Swing Loan Lender not later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the day of the proposed borrowing. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Swing Loan Lender agrees to make, on the date of the relevant Swing Loan Request, the Swing Loan specified in such Swing Loan Request available to the Swing Loan Borrower. The Swing Loan Lender shall not be required to determine that, or take notice whether, the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.02 have been satisfied in connection with the making of any Swing Loan. (b) Any Swing Loan Lender may demand at any time that each Lender pay in Dollars to the Administrative Agent, for the account of such Swing Loan Lender, in the manner provided in clause (c) below, such Lender’s pro rata share of all or a portion of its outstanding Swing Loans, which demand shall be made through the Administrative Agent, shall be in writing and shall specify the outstanding principal amount of the Swing Loans demanded to be paid; provided however, the Swing Loan Lenders shall not make any Swing Loan in the period commencing on the first Business Day after it receives written notice from any Lender that one or more of the conditions precedent contained in Section 4.02 shall not on such date be satisfied or duly waived and ending when such conditions are satisfied or duly waived. (c) The Administrative Agent shall forward each demand referred to in clause (b) above to each Lender on the day such demand is received by the Administrative Agent (except that any such demand received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. (New York time) on any Business Day or on a day that is not a Business Day shall not be required to be forwarded to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent until the next succeeding Business Day), together with a statement prepared by the Administrative Agent specifying the amount in Dollars of each Lender’s pro rata share of the aggregate principal amount of the Swing Loans demanded to be paid pursuant to such demand, and, notwithstanding whether or not the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.02 shall have been satisfied (which conditions precedent the Lenders hereby irrevocably waive), each Lender shall, before 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the Business Day next succeeding the date of such Lender’s receipt of such demand, make available to the Administrative Agent, in immediately available funds in Dollars, for the account of the applicable Swing Loan Lender, the amount specified in such statement. Upon such payment by a Lender, such Lender shall, except as provided in clause (d) below, be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan in Dollars in an amount equal to such payment to the Swing Loan Borrower (and the Swing
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 65 Loan Borrower hereby authorizes the making of such Loan). The Administrative Agent shall use such funds to repay the Swing Loans to such Swing Loan Lender. To the extent that any Lender fails to make such payment available to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Swing Loan Lender, the Swing Loan Borrower shall repay such Swing Loan or Swing Loans, as the case may be, on demand. (d) If for any reason the Swing Loans cannot be refinanced by such Loans in accordance with clause (c) above, each Lender shall acquire, without recourse or warranty, an undivided participation in each Swing Loan otherwise required to be repaid by such Lender pursuant to clause (c) above, which participation shall be in a principal amount equal to such Lender’s pro rata share of such Swing Loan, by paying in Dollars to the applicable Swing Loan Lender on the date on which such Lender would otherwise have been required to make a payment in respect of such Swing Loan pursuant to clause (c) above, in immediately available funds, an amount equal to such Lender’s pro rata share of such Swing Loan. If all or part of such amount is not in fact made available by such Lender to such Swing Loan Lender on such date, such Swing Loan Lender shall be entitled to recover any such unpaid amount on demand from such Lender together with interest accrued from such date at the Federal Funds Rate for the first Business Day after such payment was due and thereafter at the rate of interest then applicable to Base Rate Loans. (e) From and after the date on which any Lender (i) is deemed to have made a Loan pursuant to clause (c) above with respect to any Swing Loan or (ii) purchases an undivided participation interest in a Swing Loan pursuant to clause (d) above, the Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute to such Lender such Lender’s pro rata share of all payments of principal of and interest received by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the applicable Swing Loan Lender on account of such Swing Loan (all of which such payments shall be made in Dollars) other than those received from a Lender pursuant to clause (c) or (d) above and subject to Section 2.16 with regard to any Defaulting Lender. If any payment received and so distributed by any Swing Loan Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swing Loan is required to be returned by the Swing Loan Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 9.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swing Loan Lender in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to such Swing Loan Lender its pro rata share thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. The Administrative Agent shall make such demand upon the request of such Swing Loan Lender. The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. (f) The parties hereto acknowledge that the Swing Loan Lenders may from time to time make loans to the Swing Loan Borrower pursuant to an overdraft, autoborrow or similar arrangement (the “Overdraft Facility”). The loans made pursuant to the Overdraft Facility (the “Overdraft Advances”) shall be deemed Swing Loans for all purposes hereof and shall be subject to all of the provisions hereof; provided that (1) provisions relating to the fact that the Overdraft Facility is an uncommitted facility shall prevail; (2) the borrowing procedures set forth in the Overdraft Documents shall prevail in the event of any conflict between such borrowing procedures and clause (a) above; (3) the optional prepayment provisions set forth in the Overdraft Documents shall prevail in the event of any conflict between such provisions and Section 2.07; (4) any mandatory prepayment provisions set forth in the Overdraft Documents shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of or replacement of, the mandatory prepayment provisions set forth in
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 66 Section 2.07; and (5) interest on each Overdraft Advance shall be due and payable in arrears on each date set forth in the Overdraft Documents in the event of any conflict between such interest payment dates and the interest payment dates set forth herein. (g) Each Lender’s obligation to make Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Loans pursuant to this Section 3.03 shall be absolute and unconditional, and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against any Swing Loan Lender, any Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (iii) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing. No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Swing Loan Borrower to repay any Swing Loans made to it, together with interest as provided herein. (h) Any Swing Loan Lender may resign at any time upon not less than 90 days’ prior written notice to the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent, during which period such Swing Loan Lender shall cooperate with the U.S. Borrower in putting in place a new Swing Loan Lender designated by the U.S. Borrower and acceptable to the Administrative Agent; provided, that such resigning Swing Loan Lender shall retain all the rights and obligations of a Swing Loan Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swing Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require the Lenders to make Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swing Loans pursuant to this Section 3.03. If there are no other Swing Loan Lenders, and no such Swing Loan Lender is appointed, in each case prior to the effectiveness of such resignation, the Swing Loan Borrower shall not be entitled to request Swing Loans until such a Swing Loan Lender is appointed. SECTION 3.04. Issuance of Letters of Credit. (a) No Issuing Bank shall be under any obligation to Issue any Letter of Credit upon the occurrence of any of the following: (i) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall purport by its terms to enjoin or restrain such Issuing Bank from Issuing such Letter of Credit or any Requirement of Law applicable to such Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such Issuing Bank shall prohibit, or request that such Issuing Bank refrain from, the Issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon such Issuing Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction or reserve or capital requirement (for which such Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated) not in effect on the date of this Agreement or that would result in any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense that was not applicable, in effect or known to such Issuing Bank as of the date of this Agreement and that such Issuing Bank in good faith deems material to it; (ii) such Issuing Bank shall have received any written notice of the type described in clause (c) below; (iii) after giving effect to the Issuance of such Letter of Credit, (A) the aggregate Total Outstandings would exceed the aggregate of the Commitments in
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 67 effect at such time or (B) the Letter of Credit Obligations at such time would exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit; (iv) any fees due in connection with any Issuance have not been paid; (v) such Letter of Credit is requested to be Issued in a form that is not acceptable to such Issuing Bank; or (vi) such Letter of Credit is requested to be denominated in any currency other than Dollars or (if requested by a Euro Borrower) Euros. None of the Lenders (other than the Issuing Banks in their capacity as such) shall have any obligation to Issue any Letter of Credit. (b) In connection with the Issuance of each Letter of Credit, the U.S. Borrower or a Euro Borrower, as applicable and appropriate, shall give the relevant Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent at least two Business Days’ prior written notice, in form and substance acceptable to the applicable Issuing Bank, of the requested Issuance of such Letter of Credit (a “Letter of Credit Request”). Such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the Issuing Bank of such Letter of Credit, the Currency of Issuance (Dollars or Euros) and face amount of the Letter of Credit requested, the date of Issuance of such requested Letter of Credit, the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which date shall be a Business Day) and the Person for whose benefit the requested Letter of Credit is to be issued. Such notice, to be effective, must be received by the relevant Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the second Business Day prior to the date of the requested Issuance of such Letter of Credit. (c) Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this Section 3.04 and in Section 2.04, the relevant Issuing Bank shall, on the requested date, Issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the applicable Borrower in accordance with such Issuing Bank’s usual and customary business practices. No Issuing Bank shall Issue any Letter of Credit in the period commencing on the first Business Day after it receives written notice from any Lender that one or more of the conditions precedent contained in Section 4.02 shall not on such date be satisfied or duly waived and ending when such conditions are satisfied or duly waived. The relevant Issuing Bank shall not otherwise be required to determine that, or take notice whether, the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.02 have been satisfied in connection with the Issuance of any Letter of Credit. (d) If requested by the relevant Issuing Bank, prior to the issuance of each Letter of Credit by such Issuing Bank, and as a condition of such Issuance and of the participation of each Lender in the Letter of Credit Obligations arising with respect thereto in accordance with clause (f) below, the applicable Borrower shall have delivered to such Issuing Bank a letter of credit reimbursement agreement, in such form as the Issuing Bank may employ in its ordinary course of business for its own account (a “Letter of Credit Reimbursement Agreement”), signed by such Borrower, and such other documents or items as may be required pursuant to the terms thereof. In the event of any conflict between the terms of any Letter of Credit Reimbursement Agreement and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall govern.
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 68 (e) Each Issuing Bank shall: (i) give the Administrative Agent written notice (which writing may be a telecopy or electronic mail) of the Issuance of a Letter of Credit Issued by it, of all drawings under a Letter of Credit Issued by it and the payment (or the failure to pay when due) by the applicable Borrower of any Reimbursement Obligation when due, other than drawings under Letters of Credit issued to support the IRB Obligations and reimbursement payments in respect thereof that are made when due (which notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit by telecopy, electronic mail or similar transmission to each Lender); (ii) upon the request of any Lender, furnish to such Lender, copies of any Letter of Credit Reimbursement Agreement to which such Issuing Bank is a party and such other documentation as may reasonably be requested by such Lender; and (iii) no later than 10 Business Days following the last day of each calendar month, provide to the Administrative Agent (and the Administrative Agent shall provide a copy to each Lender requesting the same) and the U.S. Borrower separate schedules for Documentary Letters of Credit and Standby Letters of Credit issued by it under the Letter of Credit Sub-Facility, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, setting forth the aggregate Letter of Credit Obligations outstanding at the end of each month and any information requested by the U.S. Borrower or the Administrative Agent relating thereto. (f) Immediately upon the issuance by an Issuing Bank of a Letter of Credit in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to each Lender, and each Lender shall be deemed irrevocably and unconditionally to have purchased and received from such Issuing Bank, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation, to the extent of such Lender’s pro rata share of the Commitments, in such Letter of Credit and the obligations of the applicable Borrower with respect thereto (including all Letter of Credit Obligations with respect thereto) and any security therefor and guaranty pertaining thereto. (g) Each Borrower agrees to pay to the Issuing Bank of any Letter of Credit the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of all Reimbursement Obligations owing to such Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit issued for its account no later than the date that is the next succeeding Business Day after such Borrower receives written notice from such Issuing Bank that payment has been made under such Letter of Credit (the “Reimbursement Date”), irrespective of any claim, set-off, defense or other right that such Borrower may have at any time against such Issuing Bank or any other Person. (h) In the event that any Issuing Bank makes any payment under any Letter of Credit and the applicable Borrower shall not have repaid the Dollar Equivalent of such amount to such Issuing Bank pursuant to clause (g) or any such payment by such Borrower is rescinded or set aside for any reason, such Reimbursement Obligation shall be payable on demand with interest thereon computed (i) from the date on which such Reimbursement Obligation arose to the Reimbursement Date, at the rate of interest applicable during such period to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans and (ii) from the Reimbursement Date until the date of repayment in full, at the rate of interest applicable during such period to past due Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans, and such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, which shall
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 69 promptly notify each Lender of such failure, and each Lender shall promptly and unconditionally pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank the amount of such Lender’s pro rata share of such payment in Dollars (based upon the Dollar Equivalent of such amount on the date of such payment) and in immediately available funds. If the Administrative Agent so notifies such Lender prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on any Business Day, such Lender shall make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank its pro rata share of the amount of such payment on such Business Day in immediately available funds. Upon such payment by a Lender, such Lender shall, except during the continuance of a Default or Event of Default under Section 7.01(e) and notwithstanding whether or not the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.02 shall have been satisfied (which conditions precedent the Lenders hereby irrevocably waive), be deemed to have made a Revolving Loan to applicable Borrower in the principal amount of such payment. Whenever any Issuing Bank receives from the U.S. Borrower a payment of a Reimbursement Obligation as to which the Administrative Agent has received for the account of such Issuing Bank any payment from a Lender pursuant to this clause (h), such Issuing Bank shall pay to the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to each Lender, in immediately available funds, an amount equal to such Lender’s pro rata share of the amount of such payment adjusted, if necessary, to reflect the respective amounts the Lenders have paid in respect of such Reimbursement Obligation. (i) If and to the extent such Lender shall not have so made its pro rata share of the amount of the payment required by clause (h) above, as applicable, available to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank, such Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank forthwith on demand any such unpaid amount together with interest thereon, for the first Business Day after payment was first due at the Federal Funds Rate and, thereafter until such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank, at the rate per annum applicable to Base Rate Loans under the Facility. (j) Each Borrower’s obligation to pay each Reimbursement Obligation and the obligations of the Lenders to make payments to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Banks with respect to Letters of Credit shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, under any and all circumstances whatsoever, including the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, and irrespective of any of the following: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or any Loan Document, or any term or provision therein; (ii) any amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from all or any of the provisions of any Letter of Credit or any Loan Document; (iii) the existence of any claim, set off, defense or other right that such Borrower, any other party guaranteeing, or otherwise obligated with, such Borrower, any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof or any other Person may at any time have against the beneficiary under any Letter of Credit, any Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other related or unrelated agreement or transaction;
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 70 (iv) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; (v) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; and (vi) any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind of the Issuing Bank, the other Lenders, the Administrative Agent or any other Person or any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section 3.04 or Section 2.04, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of such Borrower’s obligations hereunder. Any action taken or omitted to be taken by the relevant Issuing Bank under or in connection with any Letter of Credit, if taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall not put such Issuing Bank under any resulting liability to the applicable Borrower or any Lender. In determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof, the Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary and, in making any payment under any Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may rely exclusively on the documents presented to it under such Letter of Credit as to any and all matters set forth therein, including reliance on the amount of any draft presented under such Letter of Credit, whether or not the amount due to the beneficiary thereunder equals the amount of such draft and whether or not any document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be insufficient in any respect, if such document on its face appears to be in order, and whether or not any other statement or any other document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be forged or invalid or any statement therein proves to be inaccurate or untrue in any respect whatsoever and any noncompliance in any immaterial respect of the documents presented under such Letter of Credit with the terms thereof shall, in each case, be deemed not to constitute willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Issuing Bank. (k) Schedule 2.04 (Existing Letters of Credit) contains a schedule of Existing Letters of Credit issued for the account of the U.S. Borrower. On the Effective Date (i) such letters of credit, to the extent outstanding, shall be automatically and without further action by the parties thereto converted to Letters of Credit issued pursuant to this Section 3.04 and Section 2.04 for the account of the U.S. Borrower and subject to the provisions hereof, and for this purpose the fees specified in Section 2.05(b) shall be payable (in substitution for any fees set forth in the applicable letter of credit reimbursement agreements or applications relating to such letters of credit) as if such letters of credit had been issued on the Effective Date, other than fees with respect to issuance, amendment or transfer that might otherwise apply as the result of such letters of credit being treated as if issued on the Effective Date, (ii) the amount of such letters of credit shall be included in the calculation of Letter of Credit Obligations and (iii) all liabilities of the U.S. Borrower with respect to such letters of credit shall constitute Reimbursement Obligations and/or obligations under the Facility. SECTION 3.05. Increased Costs. (a) If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change (other than any change by way of imposition or increase of reserve requirements included in the Eurocurrency
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 71 Rate Reserve Percentage, in each case as of the date of determination thereof) in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation, in each case after the date hereof or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) which implements any introduction or change specified in clause (i) above, there shall be (x) any increase in the cost to any Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Swing Loans or (y) subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, or (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto, then the Borrowers shall from time to time, within ten Business Days after written demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased cost incurred during the 90-day period prior to the date of such demand. A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent by such Lender and showing in reasonable detail the basis for the calculation thereof, shall be prima facie evidence of such costs. (b) If any Lender determines that compliance with (i) the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of, any law or regulation, in each case after the date hereof, or (ii) any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) which implements any introduction or change specified in clause (i) above, affects or would affect the amount of capital or liquidity required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender and that the amount of such capital or liquidity is increased by or based upon the existence of such Lender’s commitment to lend or to issue or participate in Letters of Credit hereunder and other commitments of this type, then, within ten Business Days after written demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrowers shall from time to time pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender or such corporation in the light of such circumstances for such increase in capital or liquidity incurred during the six-month period prior to the date of such demand, to the extent that such Lender reasonably determines such increase in capital or liquidity to be allocable to the existence of such Lender’s commitment to lend or to issue or participate in Letters of Credit hereunder. A certificate as to such amounts submitted to the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent by such Lender and showing in reasonable detail the basis for the calculation thereof shall be prima facie evidence of such costs. (c) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.05 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation, provided that no Borrower shall be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the U.S. Borrower of the circumstances giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the circumstances giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). (d) Without limiting the effect of the foregoing, the Borrowers shall pay to each Lender on the last day of each Interest Period so long as such Lender is maintaining reserves against Eurocurrency Liabilities (or so long as such Lender is maintaining reserves against any
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 72 other category of liabilities that includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on Eurocurrency Rate Loans is determined as provided in this Agreement or against any category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Lender that includes any Eurocurrency Rate Loans) an additional amount (determined by such Lender and notified to the U.S. Borrower through the Administrative Agent) equal to the product of the following for each Eurocurrency Rate Loan for each day during such Interest Period: (i) the principal amount of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan outstanding on such day; and (ii) the remainder of (x) a fraction the numerator of which is the rate (expressed as a decimal) at which interest accrues on such Eurocurrency Rate Loan for such Interest Period as provided in this Agreement (less the Applicable Margin) and the denominator of which is one minus the Eurocurrency Rate Reserve Percentage in effect on such day minus (y) such numerator; and (iii) 1/360. (e) If the U.S. Borrower is required to pay any Lender any amounts under this Section 3.05, the applicable Lender shall be an “Affected Person”, and the U.S. Borrower shall have the rights set forth in Section 3.08 to replace such Affected Person. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, for purposes of this Section 3.05, each of (i) the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and all requests, rules, guidelines and directives promulgated thereunder and (ii) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives concerning capital adequacy or liquidity effective after the date hereof promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities are deemed to have been introduced or adopted after the date hereof, regardless of the date enacted or adopted. SECTION 3.06. Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Lender or any Swing Loan Lender, as the case may be, shall notify the Administrative Agent that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such Lender or such Swing Loan Lender, as the case may be, or its Eurocurrency Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Swing Loans, as the case may be, or to fund or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Swing Loans hereunder, as the case may be, then, subject to the provisions of Section 3.08, (i) the obligation of such Lender to make Eurocurrency Rate Loans hereunder or the obligations of such Swing Loan Lender to make Swing Loans hereunder (including, without limitation, to any Borrower who is also a Foreign Subsidiary), as the case may be, shall be suspended until the first date on which the circumstances causing such suspension cease to exist (and, to the extent required by applicable Law, cancelled), (ii) any Eurocurrency Rate Loans made or to be made by such Lender shall be converted automatically to Base Rate Loans and any Swing Loans made or to be made by such Swing Loan Lender shall be converted to Swing Loans denominated in Dollars and (iii) such Lender or such Swing Loan Lender, as the case may be, shall be an “Affected Person”, and the U.S. Borrower shall have the right set forth in Section 3.08 to replace such Affected Person. In the event of such a suspension, such Lender or such Swing Loan Lender, as the case may be, shall review the circumstances giving rise to such suspension at least weekly and shall notify the U.S.
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 73 Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Swing Loan Lenders and the Lenders promptly of the end of such suspension, and thereafter the applicable Borrower shall be entitled to borrow Eurocurrency Rate Loans from such Lender or the Swing Loan Borrower shall be entitled to borrow Swing Loans from such Swing Loan Lender, as the case may be. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, for purposes of this Section 3.06, each of (i) the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and all requests, rules, guidelines and directives promulgated thereunder and (ii) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives concerning capital adequacy or liquidity effective after the date hereof promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities are deemed to have been introduced or adopted after the date hereof, regardless of the date enacted or adopted. SECTION 3.07. Reasonable Efforts to Mitigate. Each Lender and each Swing Loan Lender shall use its reasonable best efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to minimize any amounts payable by the Borrowers under Section 3.05 and to minimize any period of illegality described in Section 3.06. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Lender and each Swing Loan Lender agrees that, to the extent reasonably possible to such Lender or such Swing Loan Lender, as the case may be, it will change its Eurocurrency Lending Office if such change would eliminate or reduce amounts payable to it under Section 3.05 or eliminate any illegality of the type described in Section 3.06, as the case may be. Each Lender and each Swing Loan Lender further agrees to notify the U.S. Borrower promptly, but in any event within five Business Days, after such Lender or such Swing Loan Lender, as the case may be, learns of the circumstances giving rise to such a right to payment or such illegality have changed such that such right to payment or such illegality, as the case may be, no longer exists.

In the event that S&P and Moody’s shall, after the date that any Person becomes a Lender, downgrade the long-term certificate of deposit ratings of such Lender, and the resulting ratings shall be below BBB- and Baa3, respectively, or the equivalent, then the Issuing Banks shall in consultation with the U.S. Borrower have the right, but not the obligation, at their own expense, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, to replace such Lender with an Eligible Assignee, and such Lender hereby agrees to transfer and assign without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.07 (other than clause (a)(iv) thereof)) all the interests, rights and obligations in respect of its Commitment to an Eligible Assignee; provided however, that (x) no such assignment shall conflict with any law, rule or regulation or order of any governmental authority and (y) the Issuing Banks or such Eligible Assignee, as the case may be, shall pay to such Lender in same day funds on the date of such assignment the principal of and interest accrued to the date of payment on the Loans made by such Lender and such Lender’s participation in any Letters of Credit hereunder and all other amounts accrued for such Lender’s account or owed to it hereunder. Upon any such termination or assignment, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be obligated under Section 8.05 and be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.04, as well as to any fees and other amounts accrued for its account under Section 2.05, 2.12 or 3.05 and not yet paid.

(e) (i) The Administrative Agent may, without notice to the U.S. Borrower or any other Person except as required by law and at any time or from time to time, charge, set-off and otherwise apply all or any part of the L/C Cash Collateral Account against the obligations of the Borrowers in respect of Letters of Credit (collectively, the “L/C Cash Collateral Account Obligations”) or any part thereof. The Administrative Agent agrees to notify the U.S. Borrower promptly after any such set-off and application, provided that the failure of the Administrative Agent to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. (ii) The Administrative Agent may also exercise in respect of the L/C Cash Collateral Account Collateral, in addition to other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to it, all the rights and remedies of a secured party on default under the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in the State of New York at that time (the “UCC”) (whether or not the UCC applies to the affected L/C Cash Collateral Account Collateral), and may also, without notice except as specified below, sell the L/C Cash Collateral Account Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any of the Administrative Agent’s offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future delivery, and upon such other terms as the Administrative Agent may deem commercially reasonable. Each Borrower agrees that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required by law, at least ten days’ notice to the U.S. Borrower of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification. The Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of L/C Cash Collateral Account Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Administrative Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. (iii) Any cash held by the Administrative Agent as L/C Cash Collateral Account Collateral and all cash proceeds received by the Administrative Agent in respect of any sale of, collection from, or other realization upon all or any part of the L/C Cash Collateral Account Collateral may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for, and/or then or at any time thereafter be applied in whole or in part by the Administrative Agent against, all or any part of the L/C Cash Collateral Account Obligations in such order as the Administrative
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 92 Agent shall elect. Any surplus of such cash or cash proceeds held by the Administrative Agent and remaining after payment in full of all the L/C Cash Collateral Account Obligations shall be paid over to the U.S. Borrower or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus. (f) Upon the permanent reduction from time to time of the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit in accordance with the terms thereof, the Administrative Agent shall release to the U.S. Borrower amounts from the L/C Cash Collateral Account in an amount equal to each such permanent reduction; provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to reduce the funds or other L/C Cash Collateral Account Collateral then held in the L/C Cash Collateral Account below that level that the Administrative Agent reasonably determines is required to be maintained after taking into consideration any rights or claims of any Persons other than the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. (g) In furtherance of the grant of the pledge and security interest pursuant to this Section 7.02, the U.S. Borrower hereby agrees with each Lender and the Administrative Agent that the U.S. Borrower shall give, execute, deliver, file and/or record any financing statement, notice, instrument, document, agreement or other papers that may be necessary or desirable (in the reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent) to create, preserve, perfect or validate the security interest granted pursuant hereto or to enable the Administrative Agent to exercise and enforce its rights hereunder with respect to such pledge and security interests. ARTICLE VIII THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT SECTION 8.01. Authorization and Action. Each Lender hereby appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement (including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of the Notes), the Administrative Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders and all holders of Notes; provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action which exposes the Administrative Agent to personal liability or which is contrary to this Agreement or applicable law. The Administrative Agent agrees to give to each Lender prompt notice of each notice given to it by any Borrower pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. SECTION 8.02. Reliance, Etc. (a) None of the Agents nor any of their respective directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with the Loan Documents, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent: (i) may treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof until the Administrative Agent receives and accepts an Assignment and Acceptance entered into by the Lender which is the payee of such Note, as assignor, and an Eligible Assignee, as assignee, as provided in Section 9.07; (ii) may
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 93 consult with legal counsel (including counsel for any Borrower), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (iii) makes no warranty or representation to any Lender and shall not be responsible to any Lender for any statements, warranties or representations (whether written or oral) made in or in connection with this Agreement; (iv) shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement on the part of any Borrower or to inspect the property (including the books and records) of any Borrower; (v) shall not be responsible to any Lender for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; and (vi) shall incur no liability under or in respect of this Agreement by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by electronic mail, telecopier, telegram, cable or telex) believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties. (b) The Arrangers, as such, the Co-Documentation Agents, as such, and the Syndication Agent, as such, each referred to on the cover page hereto, shall have no duties or obligations whatsoever to the Lenders under or with respect to this Agreement, the Notes or any other document or any matter related thereto. SECTION 8.03. The Agents and their Affiliates as Lenders. With respect to its respective Commitment as a Lender, the Loans made by it as a Lender, the Letters of Credit issued by it as an Issuing Bank and the Notes issued to it as a Lender, each of the Agents party to this Agreement as Lender and/or Issuing Bank shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender in its capacity as a Lender and/or any other Issuing Bank in its capacity as Issuing Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent; and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include each Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender and/or an Issuing Bank. Each Agent, in its individual capacity as a Lender and/or an Issuing Bank, and its affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, and generally engage in any kind of business with, any Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries and any Person who may do business with or own securities of any Borrower or any such Subsidiary, all as if the such Agent were not an Agent under this Agreement and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders. SECTION 8.04. Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender and based on the financial statements referred to in Section 5.03 and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement. SECTION 8.05. Indemnification. The Lenders severally agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and each Swing Loan Lender (in each case to the extent the U.S. Borrower fails to pay the same pursuant to Section 9.04(b) or otherwise), ratably according to their respective pro rata share, from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against such Person in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any action taken or omitted by such Person under this Agreement in its respective capacity as an agent
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 94 hereunder, provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Swing Loan Lender, as applicable. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and expenses of counsel but excluding normal administrative expenses expressly excluded under Section 9.04(a)) incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, to the extent that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by the U.S. Borrower as required under Section 9.04(a). SECTION 8.06. Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the U.S. Borrower and may be removed at any time with or without cause by the Required Lenders. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent with the consent of the U.S. Borrower, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent’s giving of notice of resignation or the Required Lenders’ removal of the retiring Administrative Agent, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be an Eligible Assignee and a commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement. After any retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation or removal hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article VIII (The Administrative Agent) shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement. SECTION 8.07. No Other Duties, Etc. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Arrangers, the Co-Documentation Agents or the Syndication Agent listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as a Lender hereunder. SECTION 8.08. Incorrect Payment. (a) If the Administrative Agent notifies a Lender or any Person who has received funds on behalf of a Lender (any such Lender or other recipient, a “Payment Recipient”) that the Administrative Agent has determined in its sole discretion (whether or not after receipt of any notice under immediately succeeding clause (b)) that any funds received by such Payment Recipient from the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates were erroneously transmitted to, or otherwise erroneously or mistakenly received by, such Payment Recipient (whether or not known to such Lender or other Payment Recipient on its behalf) (any such funds, whether received as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees, distribution or
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 95 otherwise, individually and collectively, an “Erroneous Payment”) and demands the return of such Erroneous Payment (or a portion thereof), such Erroneous Payment shall at all times remain the property of the Administrative Agent and shall be segregated by the Payment Recipient and held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, and such Lender shall (or, with respect to any Payment Recipient who received such funds on its behalf, shall cause such Payment Recipient to) promptly, but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter, return to the Administrative Agent the amount of any such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made, in same day funds (in the currency so received), together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such Payment Recipient to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in same day funds at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time in effect. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Payment Recipient under this clause (a) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. (b) Without limiting immediately preceding clause (a), each Lender, or any Person who has received funds on behalf of a Lender, hereby further agrees that if it receives a payment, prepayment or repayment (whether received as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees, distribution or otherwise) from the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates) (x) that is in a different amount than, or on a different date from, that specified in a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment, (y) that was not preceded or accompanied by a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates), or (z) that such Lender, or other such recipient, otherwise becomes aware was transmitted, or received, in error or by mistake (in whole or in part) in each case: (i) (A) in the case of immediately preceding clauses (x) or (y), an error shall be presumed to have been made (absent written confirmation from the Administrative Agent to the contrary) or (B) an error has been made (in the case of immediately preceding clause (z)), in each case, with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment; and (ii) such Lender shall (and shall cause any other recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf to) promptly (and, in all events, within one Business Day of its knowledge of such error) notify the Administrative Agent of its receipt of such payment, prepayment or repayment, the details thereof (in reasonable detail) and that it is so notifying the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 8.08(b). (c) Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off, net and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document, or otherwise payable or distributable by the Administrative Agent to such Lender from any source, against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under immediately preceding clause (a) or under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement. (d) In the event that an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered by the Administrative Agent for any reason, after demand therefor by the Administrative Agent in accordance with immediately preceding clause (a), from any Lender that
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 96 has received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) (and/or from any Payment Recipient who received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) on its respective behalf) (such unrecovered amount, an “Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency”), upon the Administrative Agent’s notice to such Lender at any time, (i) such Lender shall be deemed to have assigned its Loans (but not its Commitments) with respect to which such Erroneous Payment was made (the “Erroneous Payment Impacted Loan”) in an amount equal to the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (or such lesser amount as the Administrative Agent may specify) (such assignment of the Loans (but not Commitments) of the Erroneous Payment Impacted Loan, the “Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment”) at par plus any accrued and unpaid interest (with the assignment fee to be waived by the Administrative Agent in such instance), and is hereby (together with the Borrower) deemed to execute and deliver an Assignment and Acceptance (or, to the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Acceptance by reference pursuant to a Platform as to which the Administrative Agent and such parties are participants) with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, and such Lender shall deliver any Notes evidencing such Loans to the U.S. Borrower or the Administrative Agent, (ii) the Administrative Agent as the assignee Lender shall be deemed to acquire the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, (iii) upon such deemed acquisition, the Administrative Agent as the assignee Lender shall become a Lender hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment and the assigning Lender shall cease to be a Lender hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, its obligations under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement and its applicable Commitments which shall survive as to such assigning Lender and (iv) the Administrative Agent may reflect in the Register its ownership interest in the Loans subject to the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment. The Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, sell any Loans acquired pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment and upon receipt of the proceeds of such sale, the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency owing by the applicable Lender shall be reduced by the net proceeds of the sale of such Loan (or portion thereof), and the Administrative Agent shall retain all other rights, remedies and claims against such Lender (and/or against any recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf). For the avoidance of doubt, no Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment will reduce the Commitments of any Lender and such Commitments shall remain available in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In addition, each party hereto agrees that, except to the extent that the Administrative Agent has sold a Loan (or portion thereof) acquired pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent may be equitably subrogated, the Administrative Agent shall be contractually subrogated to all the rights and interests of the applicable Lender under the Loan Documents with respect to each Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (the “Erroneous Payment Subrogation Rights”). (e) The parties hereto agree that an Erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any Obligations owed by any Borrower, except, in each case, to the extent such Erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect to the amount of such Erroneous Payment that is, comprised of funds received by the Administrative Agent from any Borrower for the purpose of making such Erroneous Payment. (f) To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Payment Recipient shall assert any right or claim to an Erroneous Payment, and hereby waives, and is deemed to waive, any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by the Administrative Agent for the return of any Erroneous Payment
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 97 received, including without limitation waiver of any defense based on “discharge for value” or any similar doctrine. (g) Each party’s obligations, agreements and waivers under this Section 8.08 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and/or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations (or any portion thereof) under any Loan Document. ARTICLE IX MISCELLANEOUS SECTION 9.01. Amendments, Etc. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the Notes, nor consent to any departure by any Borrower therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Required Lenders, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided however, that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all the Lenders, do any of the following: (a) waive any of the conditions specified in Section 4.01 or 4.02, (b) reduce any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, (c) postpone any date fixed for any payment of any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, (d) change the percentage of the Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans, or the number of Lenders, which shall be required for the Lenders or any of them to take any action hereunder, (e) release the Guaranty set forth in Article X (Guaranty) or (f) amend this Section 9.01 or any other Section of this Agreement, the effect of which amendment is to alter the pro rata sharing of payments or pro rata funding required thereby; and provided further that (1) no amendment, waiver or consent shall affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, and any Issuing Bank or any Swing Loan Lender, as the case may be, under this Agreement or any Note, unless such amendment, waiver or consent is in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Swing Loan Lender, as the case may be, in addition to the Lenders required above to take such action, (2) subject to the provisions of Sections 2.06 and 2.15, no amendment, waiver or consent shall reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Revolving Loans or Notes or postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Revolving Loans or Notes, unless in each case signed by all of the Lenders, (3) no amendment, waiver or consent shall reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Swing Loans or postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Swing Loans, unless in each case signed by all of the affected Swing Loan Lenders, (4) no amendment, waiver or consent shall reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Letter of Credit Loans or postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Letter of Credit Loans, unless in each case signed by each affected Lender, (5) subject to the provisions of Sections 2.06 and 2.15, no amendment, waiver or consent shall extend the Termination Date of the Commitment or increase the Commitment of any Lender or subject any Lender to any additional obligations, unless signed by such Lender and (6) no amendment, waiver or consent shall be made to Section 2.04, unless signed by each Lender affected by such amendment, waiver or consent. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, during such period as a Lender is a Defaulting Lender, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, such Defaulting Lender will not be entitled to vote in respect of amendments and waivers hereunder and the Commitment and the outstanding Loans or other extensions of credit of such Lender hereunder will not be
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 98 taken into account in determining whether the Required Lenders or all of the Lenders, as required, have approved any such amendment or waiver (and the definition of “Required Lenders” will automatically be deemed modified accordingly for the duration of such period); provided that any such amendment or waiver that would increase or extend the term of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender, extend the date fixed for the payment of principal or interest owing to such Defaulting Lender hereunder, reduce the principal amount of any obligation owing to such Defaulting Lender, reduce the amount of or the rate or amount of interest on any amount owing to such Defaulting Lender or of any fee payable to such Defaulting Lender hereunder, or alter the terms of this proviso, will require the consent of such Defaulting Lender.

The U.S. Borrower (on behalf of itself and on behalf of each Borrower) agrees that, unless otherwise requested by the Administrative Agent, it will provide to the Administrative Agent all information, documents and other materials that it is obligated to furnish to the
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 100 Administrative Agent pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including, without limitation, all notices, requests, financial statements, financial and other reports, certificates and other information materials, but excluding any such communication that (A) relates to a request for a new, or a Conversion of an existing, Borrowing (including any election of an interest rate or Interest Period relating thereto), (B) relates to the payment of any principal or other amount due under this Agreement prior to the scheduled date therefor, (C) provides notice of any Default or Event of Default under this Agreement, (D) is required to be delivered to satisfy any condition precedent in Article IV (Conditions of Lending) relating to the effectiveness of this Agreement and/or any Borrowing or (E) initiates or responds to legal process (all such non-excluded information being referred to herein collectively as the “Communications”), by transmitting the Communications in an electronic/soft medium (provided such Communications contain any required signatures) in a format acceptable to the Administrative Agent to the email address specified in Section 9.02(a) above or such other e-mail address designated by the Administrative Agent from time to time. (ii) Use of Web Platforms. Each party hereto agrees that the Administrative Agent may make the Communications available to the Lenders by posting the Communications on DebtDomain, IntraLinks, SyndTrak or another similar website, if any, to which each Lender and the Administrative Agent have access (the “Platform”). Nothing in this Section 9.02 shall prejudice the right of the Administrative Agent to make the Communications available to the Lenders in any other manner specified in this Agreement. (iii) E-mail Notification to Lenders. Each Lender agrees that e-mail notice to it (at the address provided pursuant to the next sentence and deemed delivered as provided in the next paragraph) specifying that Communications have been posted to the Platform shall constitute effective delivery of such Communications to such Lender for purposes of this Agreement. Each Lender agrees (i) to notify the Administrative Agent in writing (including by electronic communication) from time to time to ensure that the Administrative Agent has on record an effective e-mail address for such Lender to which the foregoing notice may be sent by electronic transmission, and (ii) that the foregoing notice may be sent to such e-mail address. (iv) Presumption as to Delivery of E-Mail. Each party agrees that any electronic communication referred to in this Section 9.02 shall be deemed delivered upon the posting of a record of such communication as “received” in the e-mail system of the recipient; provided that if such communication is not so received during normal business hours, such communication shall be deemed delivered at the opening of business on the next Business Day.

  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 101 statutory, including, without limitation, any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of third party rights or freedom from viruses or other code defects, is made by any Citigroup Party in connection with any Communications or the Platform. (vi) Limitation on use of Platform. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the U.S. Borrower has any reason to believe that either the confidentiality of the Platform, the confidentiality of electronic transmissions to the Administrative Agent, or the integrity of Communications posted on the Platform has, may have or may in the future be compromised, then the U.S. Borrower may upon notice to the Administrative Agent delivered in any manner permitted under this Agreement, either (1) suspend its obligation hereunder to transmit Communications to the Administrative Agent by electronic/soft medium, (2) instruct the Administrative Agent not to transmit to the Platform any as yet un-posted Communications, and/or (3) instruct the Administrative Agent to take commercially reasonable steps to remove any currently posted Communications from the Platform. In the event that the use of the Platform should be suspended due to any of the circumstances described in this paragraph, the U.S. Borrower agrees to deliver the Communications to each Lender via e-mail. The Lenders agree that the delivery of the Communications via e-mail shall be deemed effective upon the posting of a record of such electronic transmission as “sent” in the e-mail system of the U.S. Borrower. The Administrative Agent agrees to immediately inform the U.S. Borrower of any security issue or Communications integrity issue that comes to its attention and relates to the Platform or the Administrative Agent’s receipt of electronic Communications. SECTION 9.03. No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of any Lender the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law. SECTION 9.04. Costs and Expenses. (a) The U.S. Borrower agrees to pay, whether or not any of the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, on demand (x) all reasonable costs and expenses in connection with the preparation (excluding normal travel and related expenses incurred by the personnel of the Administrative Agent), execution, delivery, administration (excluding those which are customarily borne by the Administrative Agent), modification and amendment of this Agreement, the Notes and the other documents to be delivered hereunder, and (y) the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Administrative Agent and with respect to advising the Administrative Agent as to its rights and responsibilities under this Agreement. The U.S. Borrower further agrees to pay on demand all reasonable expenses of the Lenders (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel (including, without duplication, internal counsel)) in connection with the enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of this Agreement, the Notes and the other documents to be delivered hereunder, including, without limitation, reasonable counsel fees and expenses in connection with the enforcement of rights under this Section 9.04(a). (b) Each Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each of their Affiliates and their officers, directors,
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 102 employees, agents and advisors (each, an “Indemnified Party”) from and against any and all claims, damages, penalties, losses, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) that may be incurred by or asserted or awarded against any Indemnified Party in its agent or lending capacity under, or otherwise in connection with, the Loan Documents, in each case arising out of or in connection with or by reason of, or in connection with the preparation for a defense of, any investigation, litigation or proceeding arising out of, related to or in connection with the Loan Documents, the proposed or actual use of the proceeds therefrom or any of the other transactions contemplated thereby, whether or not such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by a Borrower, its shareholders or creditors or an Indemnified Party or any other person or an Indemnified Party is otherwise a party thereto and whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, except to the extent such claim, damage, loss, liability or expense is found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party or any of its Related Parties. Each Borrower also agrees not to assert any claim against the Administrative Agent, any Lender, any of their Affiliates, or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys and agents, on any theory of liability, for consequential, indirect, special or punitive damages arising out of or otherwise relating to any of the Loan Documents or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Loans. Each of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent agrees not to assert any claim against the U.S. Borrower, its Affiliates or any of their directors, officers, employees, attorneys and agents, on any theory of liability, for consequential, indirect, special or punitive damages arising out of or otherwise relating to any of the Loan Documents or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Loans or the Letters of Credit; provided, that such waiver of consequential, indirect, special or punitive damages shall not limit the indemnification obligations of the Borrowers under this Section 9.04(b). For purposes of this Section 9.04(b), a “Related Party” of an Indemnified Party means (i) any controlling Person, controlled Affiliate or Subsidiary of such Indemnified Party and (ii) the respective directors, officers or employees of such Indemnified Party or any of its Subsidiaries, controlled Affiliates or controlling Persons; provided that each reference to a controlling Person, controlled Affiliate, director, officer or employee in this sentence pertains to a controlling Person, controlled Affiliate, director, officer or employee involved in the preparation of the Loan Documents or the other transactions contemplated thereby. (c) If (i) any payment of principal of any Eurocurrency Rate Loan is made other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan, as a result of a payment pursuant to Section 2.15(c) or 3.05 or acceleration of the maturity of the Loans pursuant to Section 7.01 or for any other reason, (ii) the U.S. Borrower gives notice of a Loan conversion pursuant to Section 2.09(c), or (iii) a Eurocurrency Loan is assigned other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan as a result of a request of the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.08, then the U.S. Borrower shall, upon demand by any Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender any amounts required to compensate such Lender for any additional losses, costs or expenses which it may reasonably incur as a result of such payment, including, without limitation, any loss (excluding loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by any Lender to fund or maintain such Loan. (d) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the U.S. Borrower or the Lenders hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the U.S. Borrower
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 103 contained in Sections 2.12, 3.05 and 9.04, and the agreements and obligations of each Lender under Section 9.11, and the agreements and obligations of each party hereto under Sections 9.09, 9.12 and 9.13 shall survive the payment in full of principal, interest and all other amounts payable hereunder and under the Notes. SECTION 9.05. Rights of Set-off; Payments Set Aside. (a) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default each Lender and each Affiliate of a Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender or its Affiliates to or for the credit or the account of the U.S. Borrower against any and all of its obligations under the Loan Documents, of a Euro Borrower against any and all of such Euro Borrower’s obligations under the Loan Documents or of the Swing Loan Borrower against any and all of the Swing Loan Borrower’s obligations under the Loan Documents, in each case, now or hereafter existing whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and even though such Obligations may be unmatured; provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.16(a)(iii) and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the U.S. Borrower after any such set-off and application made by such Lender or its Affiliates; provided however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of each Lender under this Section 9.05 are in addition to the other rights and remedies (including other rights of set-off) that such Lender may have. (b) To the extent that the U.S. Borrower makes a payment or payments to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders or any such Person exercise their rights of setoff, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or setoff or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, then to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had not occurred. SECTION 9.06. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the U.S. Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Lender and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and each Lender and their respective successors and assigns, except that no Borrower or the Guarantor shall have the right to assign its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of each Lender. SECTION 9.07. Assignments and Participations. (a) Each Lender may assign to one or more banks or other entities all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 104 portion of its Commitments, the Loans owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it); provided however, that: (i) each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not a varying, percentage of all rights and obligations under this Agreement (other than any Swing Loans), (ii) the amount of the Commitments and/or Loans of the assigning Lender being assigned pursuant to each such assignment other than an assignment to another Lender (determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than $10,000,000 and shall be an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (iii) each such assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee, and (unless such assignment shall be to a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender, a Subsidiary of the assigning Lender, or to the bank holding company or a Subsidiary of the bank holding company of which the assigning Lender is a Subsidiary) the U.S. Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Swing Loan Lenders shall have been notified by the Administrative Agent prior to such assignment and shall have consented to such assignment (which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided that no consent of the U.S. Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default under Section 7.01(a) or (e) has occurred and is continuing; provided further, that the consent of the U.S. Borrower shall be deemed to have been received with respect to any such proposed assignment unless the U.S. Borrower has notified the Administrative Agent in writing of its objection thereto within 10 Business Days of the U.S. Borrower’s receipt of written notice thereof, and (iv) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance, together with any Note or Notes subject to such assignment and a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 paid by either the assigning Lender or the assignee; provided that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such recordation fee in the case of any such assignment. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder and (y) the Lender assignor thereunder shall relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under this Agreement, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein except for the conditions set for in clause (iv) of this Section 9.07(a), any Lender (a “Granting Lender”) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (a “SPC”), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the U.S. Borrower, the option to provide to a Borrower all or any part of a Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to such Borrower pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Loan, (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Advance, the Granting Lender
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 105 shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the Granting Lender). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9.07 except for the conditions set forth in clause (iii) of this Section 9.07(a), any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to the Granting Lender or to any Eligible Assignee (consented to by the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the account of such SPC to support the funding or maintenance of Loans and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non- public information relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC. This paragraph may not be amended without the written consent of the SPC. (b) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the Lender assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of any Borrower or the performance or observance by any Borrower of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the financial statements referred to in Section 5.03 and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms that it is an Eligible Assignee; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender. (c) Each New Lender shall submit a New Commitment Acceptance in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.06(b). Upon the execution, delivery, acceptance and recording of a New Commitment Acceptance, from and after the Increase Date related thereto such New Lender shall be a party hereto and have the rights and obligations of a Lender
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 106 hereunder having the Commitment specified therein (or such lesser Commitment as shall be allocated to such New Lender in accordance with Section 2.06(b)(vi) or 2.15(d)). By executing and delivering a New Commitment Acceptance, the New Lender thereunder confirms to and agrees with the other parties hereto as follows: (i) such New Lender hereby agrees that no Lender has made any representation or warranty, or assumes any responsibility with respect to, (x) any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or (y) the financial condition of any Borrower or the performance or observance by any Borrower of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) such New Lender confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the financial statements referred to in Section 5.03 and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such New Commitment Acceptance; (iii) such New Lender will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (iv) such New Lender confirms that it is an Eligible Assignee; (v) such New Lender appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vi) such New Lender agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender. (d) The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non- fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at its address referred to in Section 9.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance and each New Commitment Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitments of, and principal and interest amounts of the Loans owing to, each Lender from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and each Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the U.S. Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. The Administrative Agent shall provide the U.S. Borrower with a copy of the Register upon reasonable request. (e) (i) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee representing that it is an Eligible Assignee, together with any Revolving Loan Note or Notes subject to such assignment, the Administrative Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit C-1 hereto, (1) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (2) record the information contained therein in the Register and (3) give prompt notice thereof to the U.S. Borrower. Within five Business Days after its receipt of such notice, the relevant Borrower, at its own expense, shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent in exchange for the surrendered Revolving Loan Note or Notes a new Revolving Loan Note to the order of such Eligible Assignee in an amount equal to the Commitments and/or Loans assumed by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance and a new Revolving Loan Note to the order of the assigning Lender in an amount equal to the Commitments and/or Loans retained by it hereunder. Such new Revolving Loan Notes shall be in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of such surrendered
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 107 Revolving Loan Note or Notes, shall be dated the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance and shall otherwise be in substantially the form of Exhibit A-l hereto. Such surrendered Revolving Loan Note or Notes shall be marked “canceled” and shall be returned promptly to the U.S. Borrower. (ii) Upon its receipt of a New Commitment Acceptance executed by a New Lender representing that it is an Eligible Assignee, the Administrative Agent shall, if such New Commitment Acceptance has been completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit C-3 hereto, (1) accept such New Commitment Acceptance, (2) record the information contained therein in the Register and (3) give prompt notice thereof to the U.S. Borrower. Within five Business Days after its receipt of such notice, the relevant Borrower, at its own expense, shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a new Revolving Loan Note to the order of such New Lender in an amount equal to the Commitments assumed by it pursuant to such New Commitment Acceptance. Such new Revolving Loan Note shall be dated the relevant Increase Date and shall otherwise be in substantially the form of Exhibit A-l hereto. (f) Each Lender may, without the consent of, or notice to, any Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Person, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (other than (x) any natural person (or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural person), (y) any Borrower or any Affiliates of such Borrower or (z) any Defaulting Lender) in or to a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, a portion of its Commitments, the Loans owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it); provided however, that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, its Commitments hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes of this Agreement, (iv) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, (v) except in the case of a participation involving a Lender and one of its Affiliates (and this exception shall apply only so long as the participant remains an Affiliate of such Lender), the parties to each such participation shall execute a participation agreement in substantially the form of the Participation Agreement, and (vi) no participant under any such participation shall have any right to approve any amendment to or waiver of any provision of any Loan Document, or any consent to any departure by any Borrower therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment, waiver or consent would alter the principal of, or interest on, the Loan or Loans in which such participant is participating or any fees or other amounts payable to the Lenders hereunder, or postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Loans or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder. Each Lender shall provide the U.S. Borrower with a list of entities party to all Participation Agreements with such Lender upon request. Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph to the contrary, any bank that is a member of the Farm Credit System that (a) has purchased a participation of at least $10,000,000 on or after the Effective Date, (b) is, by written notice to the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent (“Voting Participant Notification”), designated by the selling Lender as being entitled to be accorded the rights of a Voting Participant hereunder (any bank that is a member of the Farm Credit System so designated being called a “Voting Participant”) and (c) receives the prior written consent of the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent to become a Voting Participant, shall be entitled to vote (and the voting rights of the selling Lender shall be correspondingly reduced), on a dollar-for-dollar basis, as if
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 108 such participant were a Lender, on any matter requiring or allowing a Lender to provide or withhold its consent, or to otherwise vote on any proposed action. To be effective, each Voting Participant Notification shall, with respect to any Voting Participant, (i) state the full name, as well as all contact information required of an assignee as set forth in Exhibit C-1 hereto and (ii) state the dollar amount of the participation purchased. The U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on information contained in notices delivered pursuant to this paragraph. The Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.12 and 3.05 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 2.12(g) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.12(g) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 3.07 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (a) of this Section; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.12 or 3.05, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.05 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the U.S. Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each participant and the principal and interest amounts of each participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations hereunder (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any participant or any information relating to a participant’s interest in any Loan or other obligation hereunder) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103−1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. (g) Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 9.07, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant, any information, including Confidential Information, relating to the Borrowers furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrowers; provided that, prior to any such disclosure of Confidential Information, the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant shall be informed of the confidential nature of such Confidential Information and shall agree to (i) preserve the confidentiality of any Confidential Information relating to the Borrowers received by it from such Lender and (ii) be bound by the provisions of Section 9.11. (h) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, an Eligible Assignee shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.12 or 3.05 than the assigning Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a change in law that occurs after the effective date of such assignment.
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 109 (i) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement, any Lender may at any time and without the consent of the Administrative Agent or any Borrower create a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Loans owing to it and the Notes held by it), including in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or any other central banking authority. SECTION 9.08. No Liability of the Issuing Banks. Each Borrower assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee of any Letter of Credit with respect to its use of such Letter of Credit. Neither any Issuing Bank nor any of their respective officers or directors shall be liable or responsible for: (a) the use that may be made of any Letter of Credit or any acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee in connection therewith; (b) the validity, sufficiency or genuineness of documents, or of any endorsement thereon, even if such documents should prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged; (c) payment by any Issuing Bank against presentation of documents that do not comply with the terms of a Letter of Credit, including failure of any documents to bear any reference or adequate reference to the Letter of Credit; or (d) any other circumstances whatsoever in making or failing to make payment under any Letter of Credit, except that each Borrower shall have a claim against an Issuing Bank, and such Issuing Bank shall be liable to such Borrower, to the extent of any direct, but not consequential, damages suffered by such Borrower that were caused by (i) such Issuing Bank’s willful misconduct or gross negligence in determining whether documents presented under any Letter of Credit comply with the terms of the Letter of Credit or (ii) such Issuing Bank’s willful failure to make lawful payment under a Letter of Credit after the presentation to it of a draft and certificates strictly complying with the terms and conditions of the Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Issuing Bank acting in good faith may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary. SECTION 9.09. Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT, AND ALL CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE) THAT MAY BE BASED UPON, ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE IN ANY WAY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY PRINCIPLE OF CONFLICTS OF LAW THAT COULD REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF ANY OTHER LAW. SECTION 9.10. Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Agreement by telecopier shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. The words “execution,” “executed,” “signed,” “signature,” and words of like import in this Agreement shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act;
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 110 provided, that, without limiting the foregoing, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, any electronic signature shall be promptly followed by such manually executed counterpart. SECTION 9.11. Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information (as defined below), except that Confidential Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates’ respective managers, administrators, trustees, partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and other representatives (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Confidential Information and instructed to keep such Confidential Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over it (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section 9.11, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, (ii) any actual or prospective party (or its managers, administrators, trustees, partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and other representatives) to any swap or derivative or similar transaction under which payments are to be made by reference to the U.S. Borrower and its obligations, this Agreement or payments hereunder, (iii) any rating agency or (iv) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar organization, (g) with the consent of the U.S. Borrower, (h) to any credit insurance provider or (i) to the extent such Confidential Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section 9.11 or (y) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the U.S. Borrower. For purposes of this Section 9.11, “Confidential Information” means all information received from the U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective certified public accountants (including the Borrowers’ Accountants) relating to the U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, provided that, in the case of information received from the U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Confidential Information as provided in this Section 9.11 shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. SECTION 9.12. Submission to Jurisdiction; Service of Process. (a) Any legal action or proceeding brought by any Borrower or any of its respective Affiliates with respect to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be brought exclusively in the courts of the State of New York located in the City of New York, borough of Manhattan, or of the United States of America for the Southern District of New York. By execution and delivery of this Agreement, each Borrower hereby accepts for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably waive any objection, including any objection to the laying of venue or
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 111 based on the grounds of forum non conveniens, that any of them may now or hereafter have to the bringing of any such action or proceeding in such respective jurisdictions. (b) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably consents to the service of any and all legal process, summons, notices and documents in any suit, action or proceeding brought in the United States of America arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the mailing (by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid) or delivering of a copy of such process to the U.S. Borrower at its address specified in Section 9.02. Each Borrower agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. (c) Nothing contained in this Section 9.12 shall affect the right of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to serve process in any other manner permitted by law or commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against the Borrowers in any other jurisdiction. SECTION 9.13. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, EACH ISSUING BANK AND EACH OF THE LENDERS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, THE LOANS, THE LETTERS OF CREDIT OR THE ACTIONS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, ANY ISSUING BANK OR ANY LENDER IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT THEREOF. SECTION 9.14. Judgment Currency. This is an international loan transaction in which the specification of Dollars or an Alternate Currency, as the case may be (the “Specified Currency”), any payment in New York City or the country of the Specified Currency, as the case may be (the “Specified Place”), is of the essence, and the Specified Currency shall be the currency of account in all events relating to Loans denominated in the Specified Currency. The payment obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement and the Notes shall not be discharged by an amount paid in another currency or in another place, whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise, to the extent that the amount so paid on conversion to the Specified Currency and transfer to the Specified Place under normal banking procedures does not yield the amount of the Specified Currency at the Specified Place due hereunder. If for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in the Specified Currency into another currency (the “Second Currency”), the rate of exchange which shall be applied shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the Specified Currency with the Second Currency on the Business Day next preceding that on which such judgment is rendered. The obligation of each Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (an “Entitled Person”) shall, notwithstanding the rate of exchange actually applied in rendering such judgment, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Entitled Person of any sum adjudged to be due hereunder or under the Notes in the Second Currency such Entitled Person may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase and transfer to the Specified Place the Specified Currency with the amount of the Second Currency so adjudged to be due; and each Borrower hereby, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, agrees to indemnify such Entitled Person against, and to pay such Entitled Person on demand in the Specified Currency, any difference between the sum originally due to such Entitled
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 112 Person in the Specified Currency and the amount of the Specified Currency so purchased and transferred. SECTION 9.15. European Monetary Union. (a) Payments by the Administrative Agent Generally. With respect to the payment of any amount denominated in Euro, the Administrative Agent shall not be liable to any of the Borrowers, the Swing Loan Lenders or any of the Lenders in any way whatsoever for any delay, or the consequences of any delay, in the crediting to any account of any amount required by this Agreement to be paid by the Administrative Agent if the Administrative Agent shall have taken all relevant steps to achieve, on the date required by this Agreement, the payment of such amount in immediately available, freely transferable, cleared funds (in Euro) to the account of any Borrower, any Swing Loan Lender or any Lender in the Principal Financial Center in the Participating Member State which such Borrower, such Swing Loan Lender or such Lender, as the case may be, shall have specified for such purpose. For the purposes of this paragraph, “all relevant steps” means all such steps as may be prescribed from time to time by the regulations or operating procedures of such clearing or settlement system as the Administrative Agent may from time to time determine for the purpose of clearing or settling payments in Euro. (b) Other Consequential Changes. Without prejudice to the respective liabilities of the Borrowers to the Lenders and the Swing Loan Lenders, and the Lenders and the Swing Loan Lenders to the Borrowers, under or pursuant to this Agreement, except as expressly provided in this Section 9.15, each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to time reasonably specify to be necessary or appropriate to reflect the introduction of or changeover to Euros in Participating Member States. SECTION 9.16. USA PATRIOT Act. Each Lender subject to the Patriot Act hereby notifies each Borrower that, pursuant to Section 326 of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the “Patriot Act”) and the Beneficial Ownership Regulation, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, including the name and address of such Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to identify each Borrower in accordance with the Patriot Act and the Beneficial Ownership Regulation. SECTION 9.17. Continued Effectiveness. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this Agreement is not intended to and shall not serve to affect a novation of the obligations under the Existing Credit Agreement, as continued hereunder. Instead, it is the express intention of the parties hereto to reaffirm the indebtedness created under the Existing Credit Agreement. The Existing Credit Agreement and all agreements, instruments and documents executed or delivered in connection with the Existing Credit Agreement shall each be deemed to be amended as of the Effective Date to the extent necessary to give effect to the provisions of this Agreement. SECTION 9.18. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank, constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 113 SECTION 9.19. No Fiduciary Duty. Each Agent, each Lender, each Issuing Bank, each Swing Loan Lender and their respective Affiliates (collectively, solely for purposes of this paragraph, the “Lenders”), may have economic interests that conflict with those of any Borrowers, its stockholders and/or its Affiliates. Each Borrower agrees that nothing in the Loan Documents or otherwise will be deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty between any Lender, on the one hand, and any Borrower, its stockholders or its Affiliates, on the other. Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that (i) the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents (including the exercise of rights and remedies hereunder and thereunder) are arm’s-length commercial transactions between the Lenders, on the one hand, and the Borrowers, on the other, and (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading thereto, (x) no Lender has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of any Borrower, its stockholders or its Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (or the exercise of rights or remedies with respect thereto) or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether any Lender has advised, is currently advising or will advise any Borrower, its stockholders or its Affiliates on other matters) or any other obligation to any Borrower except the obligations expressly set forth in the Loan Documents and (y) each Lender is acting solely as principal and not as the agent or fiduciary of any Borrower, its management, stockholders, creditors or any other Person. Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that it has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate and that it is responsible for making its own independent judgment with respect to such transactions and the process leading thereto. Each Borrower agrees that it will not claim that any Lender has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to such Borrower, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto. SECTION 9.20. Certain ERISA Matters. (a) Each Lender (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Agents, and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of any Borrowers or any other Subsidiary of the Borrowers, that at least one of the following is and will be true: (i) such Lender is not using “plan assets” (within the meaning of Section 3(42) of ERISA or otherwise) of one or more Benefit Plans with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments or this Agreement, (ii) the transaction exemption set forth in one or more PTEs, such as PTE 84-14 (a class exemption for certain transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers), PTE 95-60 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving insurance company general accounts), PTE 90-1 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTE 91-38 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving bank collective investment funds) or PTE 96-23 (a class exemption for certain transactions determined by in-house asset managers), is applicable with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement,
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 114 (iii) (A) such Lender is an investment fund managed by a “Qualified Professional Asset Manager” (within the meaning of Part VI of PTE 84-14), (B) such Qualified Professional Asset Manager made the investment decision on behalf of such Lender to enter into, participate in, administer and perform the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement, (C) the entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement satisfies the requirements of subsections (b) through (g) of Part I of PTE 84-14 and (D) to the best knowledge of such Lender, the requirements of subsection (a) of Part I of PTE 84-14 are satisfied with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement, or (iv) such other representation, warranty and covenant as may be agreed in writing between the Agent, in its sole discretion, and such Lender. (b) In addition, unless either (1) sub-clause (i) in the immediately preceding clause (a) is true with respect to a Lender or (2) a Lender has provided another representation, warranty and covenant in accordance with sub-clause (iv) in the immediately preceding clause (a), such Lender further (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Agents, and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of any Borrower, or any other Subsidiary of the Borrowers, that the Agents are not a fiduciary with respect to the assets of such Lender involved in such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement (including in connection with the reservation or exercise of any rights by any Agent under this Agreement, any Loan Document or any documents related hereto or thereto). ARTICLE X GUARANTY SECTION 10.01. Guaranty. (a) To induce the Lenders to make the Loans to the Euro Borrowers and the Swing Loan Borrower, as the case may be, and the Issuing Banks to Issue Letters of Credit for the account of the Euro Borrowers, the U.S. Borrower hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as primary obligor and not merely as surety (in such capacity, the “Guarantor”), the full and punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity or earlier, by reason of acceleration, mandatory prepayment or otherwise in accordance herewith or any other Loan Document, of the principal of and interest on the Loans made by each Lender to, and the Notes held by each Lender of, each Euro Borrower or the Swing Loan Borrower and all other amounts from time to time owing (including without limitation with respect to any Letters of Credit) to the Lenders or the Administrative Agent by any Euro Borrower or the Swing Loan Borrower under this Agreement pursuant hereto or to its Euro Borrower Designation, as applicable, and under the Notes, in each case strictly in accordance with the terms hereof or thereof (such obligations being herein collectively called, the “Guarantied Obligations”), whether or not from time to time reduced or extinguished or hereafter increased or incurred, whether or not recovery may be or hereafter may become barred by any statute of limitations, and whether enforceable or unenforceable as against any Euro Borrower or the Swing Loan Borrower, now or
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 115 hereafter existing, or due or to become due, including principal, interest (including interest at the contract rate applicable upon default accrued or accruing after the commencement of any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code, whether or not such interest is an allowed claim in such proceeding), fees and costs of collection. This guaranty constitutes a guaranty of payment and not of collection. (b) The U.S. Borrower further agrees that, (i) if any payment made by any of the Euro Borrowers or any other person and applied to the Guarantied Obligations is at any time annulled, avoided, set aside, rescinded, invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential or otherwise required to be refunded or repaid, or (ii) if any payment is made by any Lender or any other holder of Guarantied Obligations (the “Guarantied Parties”) to any Euro Borrower, its estate, trustee, receiver or any other party, including the U.S. Borrower, under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then, in each case, to the extent of such payment or repayment, the U.S. Borrower’s liability under this Section 10.01 shall be and remain in full force and effect, as fully as if such payment had never been made or, if prior thereto this guaranty set forth in this Section 10.01 shall have been cancelled or surrendered, the guaranty set forth in this Section 10.01 shall be reinstated in full force and effect, and such prior cancellation or surrender shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations of the U.S. Borrower in respect of the amount of such payment. SECTION 10.02. Authorization; Other Agreements. The Guarantied Parties are hereby authorized, without notice to or demand upon the U.S. Borrower, which notice or demand is expressly waived hereby, and without discharging or otherwise affecting the obligations of the U.S. Borrower hereunder (which shall remain absolute and unconditional notwithstanding any such action or omission to act), from time to time, to: (a) supplement, renew, extend, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment of, or other terms relating to, the Guarantied Obligations, or any part of them, or otherwise modify, amend or change the terms of any promissory note or other agreement, document or instrument (including, without limitation, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents) now or hereafter executed by any Euro Borrower and delivered to the Guarantied Parties or any of them, including, without limitation, any increase or decrease of principal or the rate of interest thereon; (b) waive or otherwise consent to noncompliance with any provision of any instrument evidencing the Guarantied Obligations, or any part thereof, or any other instrument or agreement in respect of the Guarantied Obligations (including, without limitation, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents) now or hereafter executed by any Euro Borrower and delivered to the Guarantied Parties or any of them; (c) accept partial payments on the Guarantied Obligations; (d) receive, take and hold additional security or collateral for the payment of the Guarantied Obligations or any part of them and exchange, enforce, waive, substitute, liquidate, terminate, abandon, fail to perfect, subordinate, transfer, otherwise alter and release any such additional security or collateral; (e) settle, release, compromise, collect or otherwise liquidate the Guarantied Obligations or accept, substitute, release, exchange or otherwise alter, affect or impair any
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 116 security or collateral for the Guarantied Obligations or any part of them or any other guaranty therefor, in any manner; (f) add, release or substitute any one or more other guarantors, makers or endorsers of the Guarantied Obligations or any part of them and otherwise deal with any Euro Borrower or any other guarantor, maker or endorser; (g) apply to the Guarantied Obligations any and all payments or recoveries from any Euro Borrower, from any other guarantor, maker or endorser of the Guarantied Obligations or any part of them to the Guarantied Obligations in such order as provided herein whether such Guarantied Obligations are secured or unsecured or guaranteed or not guaranteed by others; and (h) refund at any time any payment received by any Guarantied Party in respect of any of the Guarantied Obligations, and payment to such Person of the amount so refunded shall be fully guaranteed hereby even though prior thereto this Guaranty shall have been cancelled or surrendered, and such prior cancellation or surrender shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations of the U.S. Borrower hereunder in respect of the amount so refunded; even if any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of the U.S. Borrower is extinguished, affected or impaired by any of the foregoing (including, without limitation, any election of remedies by reason of any judicial, non-judicial or other proceeding in respect of the Guarantied Obligations which impairs any subrogation, reimbursement or other right of the U.S. Borrower). SECTION 10.03. Guaranty Absolute and Unconditional. The U.S. Borrower hereby waives any defense of a surety or guarantor or any other obligor on any obligations arising in connection with or in respect of any of the following and hereby agrees that its obligations under this Article X (Guaranty) are absolute and unconditional and shall not be discharged or otherwise affected as a result of: (a) the invalidity or unenforceability of any of any Euro Borrower’s obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any security for, or other guaranty of the Guarantied Obligations or any part of them, or the lack of perfection or continuing perfection or failure of priority of any security for the Guarantied Obligations or any part of them; (b) the absence of any attempt to collect the Guarantied Obligations or any part of them from any Euro Borrower or other action to enforce the same; (c) any Guarantied Parties’ election, in any proceeding instituted under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code; (d) any borrowing or grant of a Lien by any Euro Borrower, as debtor-in-possession, or extension of credit, under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code; (e) the disallowance, under Section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code, of all or any portion of the Administrative Agent’s or Lender’s claim (or claims) for repayment of the Guarantied Obligations;
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 117 (f) any use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code; (g) any agreement or stipulation as to the provision of adequate protection in any bankruptcy proceeding; (h) the avoidance of any Lien in favor of the Guarantied Parties or any of them for any reason; (i) any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, readjustment of debt, liquidation or dissolution proceeding commenced by or against any Euro Borrower, the U.S. Borrower or any of any Euro Borrower’s other Subsidiaries, including without limitation, any discharge of, or bar or stay against collecting, all or any of the Guarantied Obligations (or any part of them or interest thereon) in or as a result of any such proceeding; (j) failure by any Guarantied Party to file or enforce a claim against any Euro Borrower or its estate in any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding; (k) any action taken by any Guarantied Party that is authorized hereby; (l) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any release from any of the terms or provisions of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement; or (m) any (x) laws, regulations or acts of any legislative body or Governmental Authority or (y) any economic, political, regulatory or other events, including but not limited to, any restrictions on the conversion of currency or repatriation or control of funds or any total or partial expropriation of the Borrowers’ property, that would otherwise constitute a defense available to any obligor or guarantor of, or a discharge of, or otherwise affect, the obligations hereunder; or (n) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor or any other obligor on any obligations, other than the payment in full of the Guarantied Obligations. SECTION 10.04. Waivers. The U.S. Borrower hereby waives diligence, promptness, presentment, demand for payment or performance and protest and notice of protest, notice of acceptance and any other notice in respect of the Guarantied Obligations or any part of them, and any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of the Euro Borrower. The U.S. Borrower shall not, until the Guarantied Obligations are irrevocably paid in full and the Commitments have been terminated, assert any claim or counterclaim it may have against any Euro Borrower or set off any of its obligations to any Euro Borrower against any obligations of any Euro Borrower to it. In connection with the foregoing, the U.S. Borrower covenants that its obligations hereunder shall not be discharged, except by complete performance. SECTION 10.05. Reliance. The U.S. Borrower hereby assumes responsibility for keeping itself informed of the financial condition of the Euro Borrowers and any and all endorsers and/or other guarantors of all or any part of the Guarantied Obligations, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guarantied Obligations, or any part thereof, that diligent inquiry would reveal, and the U.S. Borrower hereby agrees that no Guarantied Party shall have any duty to advise it of information known to it regarding such
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 118 condition or any such circumstances. In the event any Guarantied Party, in its sole discretion, undertakes at any time or from time to time to provide any such information to the U.S. Borrower, such Guarantied Party shall be under no obligation (i) to undertake any investigation not a part of its regular business routine, (ii) to disclose any information which such Guarantied Party, pursuant to accepted or reasonable commercial finance or banking practices, wishes to maintain confidential or (iii) to make any other or future disclosures of such information or any other information to any Guarantied Party. SECTION 10.06. Waiver of Subrogation and Contribution Rights. Until the Guarantied Obligations have been irrevocably paid in full and the Commitments have been terminated, the U.S. Borrower shall not enforce or otherwise exercise any right of subrogation to any of the rights of the Guarantied Parties or any part of them against any Euro Borrower or any right of reimbursement or contribution or similar right against any Euro Borrower by reason of this Agreement or by any payment made by the U.S. Borrower in respect of the obligations under this Agreement or the Notes. SECTION 10.07. Subordination. The U.S. Borrower hereby agrees that upon the occurrence of any Event of Default described in Section 7.01(e), any Indebtedness of any Euro Borrower now or hereafter owing to it, whether heretofore, now or hereafter created (the “Guaranty Subordinated Debt”), is hereby subordinated to all of the obligations under this Agreement and the Notes, and that, except as expressly permitted by this agreement, the Guaranty Subordinated Debt shall not be paid in whole or in part until such obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash and this Guaranty is terminated and of no further force or effect. The U.S. Borrower shall not accept any payment of or on account of any Guaranty Subordinated Debt at any time in contravention of the foregoing. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default described in Section 7.01(e), each Euro Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent any payment of all or any part of the Guaranty Subordinated Debt and any amount so paid to the Administrative Agent shall be applied to payment of the obligations under this Agreement and the Notes as provided herein. Each payment on the Guaranty Subordinated Debt received in violation of any of the provisions hereof shall be deemed to have been received by the U.S. Borrower as trustee for the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and shall be paid over to the Administrative Agent immediately on account of the Guarantied Obligations, but without otherwise affecting in any manner the U.S. Borrower’s liability under this Article X (Guaranty). The U.S. Borrower agrees to file all claims against the Euro Borrowers in any bankruptcy or other proceeding in which the filing of claims is required by law in respect of any Guaranty Subordinated Debt, and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to all of U.S. Borrower’s rights thereunder. If for any reason the U.S. Borrower fails to file such claim at least ten Business Days prior to the last date on which such claim should be filed, the U.S. Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact and is hereby authorized to act as attorney-in-fact in the U.S. Borrower’s name to file such claim or, in the Administrative Agent’s discretion, to assign such claim to and cause proof of claim to be filed in the name of the Administrative Agent or its nominee. In all such cases, whether in administration, bankruptcy or otherwise, the person or persons authorized to pay such claim shall pay to the Administrative Agent the full amount payable on the claim in the proceeding, and, to the full extent necessary for that purpose, the U.S. Borrower hereby assigns to the Administrative Agent all of the U.S. Borrower’s rights to any payments or distributions to which the U.S. Borrower otherwise would be entitled. If the amount so paid is greater than the U.S. Borrower’s liability hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall pay the excess amount to the party entitled thereto.
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 119 SECTION 10.08. Default; Remedies. The obligations of the U.S. Borrower hereunder are independent of and separate from the Guarantied Obligations. Upon any Event of Default, the Administrative Agent may, at its sole election, proceed directly and at once, without notice, against the U.S. Borrower to collect and recover the full amount or any portion of the Guarantied Obligations then due, without first proceeding against the defaulting Euro Borrower or Euro Borrowers or any other guarantor of the Guarantied Obligations, or joining the defaulting Euro Borrower or Euro Borrowers or any other guarantor in any proceeding against the U.S. Borrower. At any time after maturity of the Guarantied Obligations, the Administrative Agent may (unless the Guarantied Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash), without notice to the U.S. Borrower, appropriate and apply toward the payment of the Guarantied Obligations (i) any indebtedness due or to become due from any Guarantied Party to the U.S. Borrower and (ii) any moneys, credits or other property belonging to the U.S. Borrower at any time held by or coming into the possession of any Guarantied Party or any of its respective Affiliates. SECTION 10.09. Irrevocability. This Guaranty set forth in this Article X (Guaranty) shall be irrevocable as to any and all of the Guarantied Obligations until the Commitments have been terminated and all monetary Guarantied Obligations then outstanding have been indefeasibly repaid in full in cash. SECTION 10.10. Setoff. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Guarantied Party and each Affiliate thereof may, without notice to the U.S. Borrower and regardless of the acceptance of any security or collateral for the payment hereof, appropriate and apply toward the payment of all or any part of the Guarantied Obligations then due and payable (i) any indebtedness due or to become due from such Guarantied Party or Affiliate thereof to the U.S. Borrower or any Euro Borrower or the Swing Loan Borrower, and (ii) any moneys, credits or other property belonging to the U.S. Borrower or any Euro Borrower or the Swing Loan Borrower, at any time held by or coming into the possession of such Guarantied Party or Affiliate thereof (other than trust accounts). SECTION 10.11. No Marshaling. The U.S. Borrower consents and agrees that no Guarantied Party or Person acting for or on behalf thereof shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of the U.S. Borrower or against or in payment of any or all of the Guarantied Obligations. SECTION 10.12. Enforcement; Amendments; Waivers. No delay on the part of any Guarantied Party in the exercise of any right or remedy arising under this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or otherwise with respect to all or any part of the Guarantied Obligations or any other guaranty of or security for all or any part of the Guarantied Obligations shall operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or partial exercise by any such Person of any such right or remedy shall preclude any further exercise thereof. Failure by any Guarantied Party at any time or times hereafter to require strict performance by the U.S. Borrower, any other guarantor of all or any part of the Guarantied Obligations or any other Person of any of the provisions, warranties, terms and conditions contained in any of the Loan Documents now or at any time or times hereafter executed by such Persons and delivered to any Guarantied Party shall not waive, affect or diminish any right of such person at any time or times hereafter to demand strict performance thereof and such right shall not be deemed to have been waived by any act or knowledge of any Guarantied Party, or its Affiliates, unless such waiver is contained in an instrument in writing, directed and delivered to such Euro Borrower or the U.S. Borrower, as applicable, specifying such waiver, and is signed by the party or parties necessary to give such
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION 120 waiver under this Agreement. No waiver of any Event of Default shall operate as a waiver of any other Event of Default or the same Event of Default on a future occasion, and no action by any Guarantied Party permitted hereunder shall in any way affect or impair any its rights and remedies or the obligations of the U.S. Borrower under this Article X (Guaranty). Any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction of the amount of any principal and/or interest owing by any Euro Borrower to any Guarantied Party shall be conclusive and binding on the U.S. Borrower irrespective of whether the U.S. Borrower was a party to the suit or action in which such determination was made.
