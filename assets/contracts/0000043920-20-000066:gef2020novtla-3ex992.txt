Any increase or decrease in the Applicable Rate resulting from a change in the Leverage Ratio shall become effective as of the first Business Day immediately following the date a Compliance Certificate is delivered pursuant to Section 6.02(a) of the Credit Agreement; provided that if a Compliance Certificate is not delivered when due in accordance with such Section, then, upon the request of the Required Lenders, Pricing Level 1 shall apply as of the first Business Day after the date on which such Compliance Certificate is delivered.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this clause, the determination of the Applicable Rate for any period shall be subject to the provisions of Section 2.10(b) of the Credit Agreement.
(f)Interest Rate. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.08(b) of the Credit Agreement, (i) each Eurodollar Rate Loan under the Incremental Term A-3 Facility shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period, plus the Applicable Rate for the Incremental Term A-3 Facility and (ii) each Base Rate Loan under the Incremental Term A-3 Facility shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate, plus the Applicable Rate for the Incremental Term A-3 Facility.
(g)Cost of Funds. On the Incremental Term A-3 Funding Date and on the date that is 2.5 years from the Incremental Term A-3 Funding Date (or if such date is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day) (each, a “Reset Date”), CoBank (x) shall determine the difference (in basis points), if any, between the Reset Date Cost of Funds (as defined below) as of such Reset Date and the Incremental Term A-3 Agreement Effective Date Cost of Funds (as defined below) and (y) thereafter shall notify the Administrative Agent, Greif Packaging and the Company of such difference by delivering a certificate in substantially the form of Exhibit
4


A hereto (or in such other form as is mutually acceptable to CoBank, the Administrative Agent, Greif Packaging and the Company) prior to such Reset Date. With respect to the calculation of interest on the portion of the Incremental Term A-3 Loan consisting of Eurodollar Rate Loans (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not Base Rate Loans), the Applicable Rate for each Interest Period shall equal the Applicable Rate as of the Incremental Term A-3 Agreement Effective Date, increased or decreased, as applicable, by the amount of such difference (in a like amount of basis points), effective from and as of such Reset Date until the earlier of (A) the next succeeding Reset Date and (B) the Incremental Term A-3 Maturity Date; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall any decrease in the Applicable Rate result in an Applicable Rate less than zero with respect to the portion of the Incremental Term A-3 Loan that are Eurodollar Rate Loans. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, such increase or decrease of the Applicable Rate shall be automatic and shall not require an amendment to this Incremental Term Loan Agreement or the consent of any Lender. As used in this Section 2(g):
(i)    “Incremental Term A-3 Agreement Effective Date Cost of Funds” means, as of the Incremental Term A-3 Effective Date, 8.1 basis points, which is the amount by which (x) the Floating Note Rate exceeds the (y) the Eurodollar Rate for an Interest Period of one month, in each case determined as of the date that is two (2) Business Days prior to Incremental Term A-3 Agreement Effective Date.
(ii)     “Floating Note Rate” means, as of any date of determination, the estimated funding cost (not the actual sale price), including standard underwriting fees, for new two and a half-year debt securities issued by The Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation into the primary market based on market observations on such date indicated at approximately 9:30 a.m., Eastern time; it being understood that such indications represent The Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation’s best estimate of the cost of new debt issuances based on a combination of daily surveys of selected farm credit selling group members (participating bond dealers) and ongoing monitoring of the fixed income markets for actual, recent, primary market issuance by other government-sponsored institutions of similar bonds and notes and pricing within related derivative markets, particularly the interest rate swap market. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, in connection with the Incremental Term A-3 Agreement Effective Date or any Reset Date, new farm credit debt securities with a two and a half year term are not then being issued into the primary market by The Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation, then “Floating Note Rate” shall mean CoBank’s best estimate of the cost of such debt securities based on market observations of synthetic (swaps) floating rate indications for similar debt securities or such other replacement benchmark, in each case, as CoBank and Greif Packaging may mutually agree upon.
(iii)     “Reset Date Cost of Funds” means, as of a Reset Date, the amount (in basis points and which amount shall be set forth as a negative number if the amount in the following clause (x) is less than the amount in the following clause (y)), if any, by which (x) the Floating Note Rate differs from (y) the Eurodollar Rate (giving effect to any alternate rate of interest implemented pursuant to Section 3.03(b) of the Credit Agreement) for an Interest Period of one month, in each case determined as of the date that is two (2) Business Days prior to such Reset Date.
5


By way of example, assuming the Incremental Term A-3 Agreement Effective Date Cost of Funds is 15 basis points, (A) if the Reset Date Cost of Funds as of a Reset Date is 35 basis points, then the Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period (with respect only to the calculation of interest on the Incremental Term Loan A-3) shall be increased by 20 basis points commencing from and as of such Reset Date until the next Reset Date or the Incremental Term A-3 Maturity Date, as applicable, and (B) if the Reset Date Cost of Funds as of a Reset Date is -5 basis points (i.e., the Floating Note Rate is 5 basis points less than the Eurodollar Rate for an Interest Period of one month, in each case as of such Reset Date), then the Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period (with respect only to the calculation of interest on the Incremental Term Loan A-3) shall be decreased by 20 basis points commencing from and as of such Reset Date until the next Reset Date or the Incremental Term A-3 Maturity Date, as applicable.
(h)Interest Payment Dates. Interest on the Incremental Term A-3 Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Incremental Term A-3 Funding Date, and on the Incremental Term A-3 Facility Maturity Date. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof and of the Credit Agreement before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.
(i)Prepayments. For the avoidance of doubt, voluntary and mandatory prepayments with respect to the Incremental Term A-3 Facility shall be governed by Section 2.05 of the Credit Agreement.
(j)Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Incremental Term A-3 Facility shall be used by Greif Packaging solely to finance (or refinance) investments made by Greif Packaging, the Company or a U.S. Subsidiary Guarantor that satisfy both of following criteria: (i) such investments are (or were) made, directly or indirectly, in order to allow existing mills of Greif Packaging to utilize waste and waste product (including mixed paper post-consumer materials and old corrugate containers) as inputs for their operations and (ii) such investments are (or were) made, directly or indirectly, in mills that are located in rural areas with populations of no more than 20,000 (collectively, the “Term A-3 Investment Purpose”). Greif Packaging, the Company and the U.S. Subsidiary Guarantors hereby covenant that the proceeds of the Incremental Term A-3 Facility shall be used solely for the Term A-3 Investment Purpose. Until the Incremental Term A-3 Funding Date, the Loan Parties agree to maintain ownership of the mills and assets that will be the subject of the investments referred to in the definition of “Term A-3 Investment Purpose” (or similar assets reasonably acceptable to CoBank). For so long as the Incremental Term A-3 Loan remains outstanding, the Loan Parties agree to maintain, in all material respects, the business of owning mills or similar assets.
(k)Ticking Fee. In consideration of the Incremental Term A-3 Facility, Greif Packaging agrees to pay to the Incremental Term A-3 Lender from the Incremental Term A-3 Agreement Effective Date until the earliest of (i) the Incremental Term A-3 Funding Date, (ii) the date upon which Greif Packaging advises the Incremental Term A-3 Lender that it will not draw the Incremental Term A-3 Loan and terminates the Incremental Term A-3 Commitment, and (iii) July 15, 2021, a ticking fee (the “Ticking Fee”) in Dollars in an amount equal to 0.35% per annum on the average daily undrawn amount of the Incremental Term A-3 Facility, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.17 of the Credit Agreement.

(b) Reset Date Cost of Funds: [___]



1 If (a) is less than (b) for Line 1 and/or Line 2, reflect as a negative number.
2 For purposes hereof, “Floating Note Rate” means, as of any date of determination, the estimated funding cost (not the actual sale price), including standard underwriting fees, for new two and a half-year debt securities issued by The Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation into the primary market based on market observations on such date indicated at approximately 9:30 a.m., Eastern time; it being understood that such indications represent The Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation’s best estimate of the cost of new debt issuances based on a combination of daily surveys of selected farm credit selling group members (participating bond dealers) and ongoing monitoring of the fixed income markets for actual, recent, primary market issuance by other government-sponsored institutions of similar bonds and notes and pricing within related derivative markets, particularly the interest rate swap market.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, in connection with the Incremental Term A-3 Agreement Effective Date or any Reset Date, new farm credit debt securities with a two and a half year term are not then being issued into the primary market by The Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation, then “Floating Note Rate” shall mean CoBank’s best estimate of the cost of such debt securities based on market observations of synthetic (swaps) floating rate indications for similar debt securities or such other replacement benchmark as CoBank and Greif Packaging may mutually agree upon.
