(c) The second sentence of Section 2.06(d) of the Credit Agreement is hereby replaced in its entirety with the following text:

In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the relevant Issuing Bank, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Company on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Company for any reason (provided that if the LC Disbursement was made in an Additional Letter of Credit Currency, then the obligation of the Revolving Lenders to make such payment shall be denominated in Dollars in an amount determined by reference to the Exchange Rate for the date on which such payment is required to be made).
(d) Section 2.06(e) of the Credit Agreement is hereby replaced in its entirety with the following text:

(e) Reimbursement. If the relevant Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Company shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent in Dollars the Dollar Amount equal to such LC Disbursement, calculated as of the date such Issuing Bank made such LC Disbursement (or if such Issuing Bank shall so elect in its sole discretion by notice to the Company, in such other Agreed Currency or Additional Letter of Credit Currency which was paid by such Issuing Bank pursuant to such LC Disbursement in an amount equal to such LC Disbursement) not later than 12:00 noon, Local Time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the Company shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., Local Time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by the Company prior to such time on such date, then not later than 12:00 noon, Local Time, on the Business Day immediately following the day that the Company receives such notice; provided that, if such LC Disbursement is not less than the Dollar Amount of $1,000,000, the Company may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.05 that such payment be financed with (i) to the extent such LC Disbursement was made in Dollars, an ABR Revolving Borrowing, Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan in Dollars in an amount equal to such LC Disbursement, (ii) to the extent that such LC Disbursement was made in a Foreign Currency (other than an Additional Letter of Credit Currency), a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing in such Foreign Currency in an amount equal to such LC Disbursement or (iii) to the extent such LC Disbursement was made in an Additional Letter of Credit Currency, an ABR Revolving Borrowing, Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan in Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar Amount of such LC Disbursement



and, in each case, to the extent so financed, the Company’s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing, Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan, as applicable. If the Company fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Company in respect thereof and such Lender’s Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Company (provided that if the LC Disbursement was made in an Additional Letter of Credit Currency, then the obligation of the Revolving Lenders to make such payment shall be denominated in Dollars in an amount determined by reference to the Exchange Rate for the date on which such payment is required to be made), in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the relevant Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Company pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to such Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Revolving Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the relevant Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Company of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement. If the Company’s reimbursement of, or obligation to reimburse, any amounts in any Foreign Currency would subject the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender to any stamp duty, ad valorem charge or similar tax that would not be payable if such reimbursement were made or required to be made in Dollars, the Company shall, at its option, either (x) pay the amount of any such tax requested by the Administrative Agent, the relevant Issuing Bank or the relevant Lender or (y) reimburse each LC Disbursement made in such Foreign Currency in Dollars, in an amount equal to the Dollar Amount, calculated using the applicable Exchange Rate, on the date such LC Disbursement is made, of such LC Disbursement.
SECTION 3. Amendment to Section 2.12. Section 2.12(b) of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by deleting the last sentence thereof and replacing it with the following text:

Participation fees and fronting fees in respect of Letters of Credit denominated (A) in Dollars shall be paid in Dollars, (B) in a Foreign Currency (other than an Additional Letter of Credit Currency) shall be paid in such Foreign Currency and (C) in an Additional Letter of Credit Currency shall be paid in (1) in the case of participation fees, in Dollars calculated using the applicable Dollar Amount and Exchange Rate as of the most recent Computation Date with respect to the applicable Letter of Credit and (2) in the case of fronting fees, in such Additional Letter of Credit Currency.
SECTION 4. Representations and Warranties. Each of the Borrowers represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and to each of the Lenders that:

Nothing herein shall be deemed to entitle any Borrower or any other Loan Party to any future consent to, or waiver, amendment, modification or other change of, any of the terms, conditions, obligations, covenants or agreements contained in the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document in similar or different circumstances. After the date hereof, any reference in the Loan Documents to the Credit Agreement shall mean the Credit Agreement as modified hereby.
