SECTION 5.03 General Immunity. Neither the Local Currency Agent nor any of its respective directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable to any of the Borrowers or any Bank for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder or under the Credit Agreement or in connection herewith or therewith except to the extent such action or inaction is found in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Person.

The Local Currency Agent may execute any of its duties hereunder and under the Credit Agreement by or through employees, agents, and attorneys-in-fact, and shall not be answerable to the Banks or the Local Currency Banks, except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized agents, for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.

The Local Currency Agent (i) may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Agent, the Local Currency Banks and the Borrowers, and may appoint one of its affiliates as successor Local Currency Agent and (ii) may be removed at any time with or without cause by the Majority Local Currency Banks. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Majority Local Currency Banks, with the consent of the Agent, shall have the right to appoint (unless, in the case of the resignation of the Local Currency Agent, the resigning Local Currency Agent has appointed one of its affiliates as successor Local Currency Agent), on behalf of the Borrowers and the Local Currency Banks, a successor Local Currency Agent. If no successor Local Currency Agent shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty days after the retiring Local Currency Agent’s giving notice of resignation or the Majority Local Currency Banks’ removal of the retiring Local Currency Agent, then the retiring Local Currency Agent may appoint, on behalf of the Borrowers and the Local Currency Banks, a successor Local Currency Agent, which need not be one of its affiliates. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, so long as no Event of Default, or event which

6


would constitute an Event of Default but for the requirement that notice be given, time elapse or both, has occurred and is continuing, each such successor Local Currency Agent shall be subject to written approval by CFSC and CIF, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Such successor Local Currency Agent shall be a commercial bank having capital and retained earnings of at least $500,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Local Currency Agent hereunder by a successor Local Currency Agent, such successor Local Currency Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Local Currency Agent, and the retiring Local Currency Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the Credit Agreement. After any retiring Local Currency Agent’s resignation hereunder as Local Currency Agent, the provisions of this Article V shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Local Currency Agent hereunder and under the Credit Agreement.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Addendum to be duly executed as a deed by their duly authorized officers, all as of the date and year first above written.
