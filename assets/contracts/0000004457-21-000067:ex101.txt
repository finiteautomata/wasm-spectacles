The Series A Notes, the Series B Notes, the Series C Notes and the Series D Notes as amended, restated or otherwise modified from time to time pursuant to Section 17 and including any such notes delivered in substitution, replacement or exchange therefor pursuant to Section 13, are referred to herein as the “Notes”.

Section 2.Sale and Purchase of Notes.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company will issue and sell to each Purchaser and each Purchaser will purchase from the Company, at the Closing provided for in Section 3, Notes in the principal amount and in the Series specified opposite such Purchaser’s name in the Purchaser Schedule at the purchase price of 100% of the principal amount thereof.

(d)No Subsidiary is subject to any legal, regulatory, contractual or other restriction (other than the agreements listed on Schedule 5.4 and customary limitations imposed by corporate law or similar statutes) restricting the ability of such Subsidiary to pay dividends out of profits or make any other similar distributions of profits to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that owns outstanding shares of capital stock or similar equity interests of such Subsidiary.

All of such financial statements (including in each case the related schedules and notes) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the respective dates specified in such Schedule and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the respective periods so specified and have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods involved except as set forth in the notes thereto (subject, in the case of any interim financial statements, to normal year‑end adjustments).  The Company and its Subsidiaries do not have any Material liabilities that are not disclosed in the Disclosure Documents.
Section 5.6.Compliance with Laws, Other Instruments, Etc.  The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the Notes will not (i) contravene, result in any breach of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien in respect of any property of the Company or any Subsidiary under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan, purchase or credit agreement, lease, corporate charter, regulations or by‑laws, shareholders agreement or any other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any Subsidiary is bound or by which the Company or any Subsidiary or any of their respective properties may be bound or affected, (ii) conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any order, judgment, decree or ruling of any court, arbitrator or Governmental Authority applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary or (iii) violate any provision of any statute or other rule or regulation of any Governmental Authority applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary.
Section 5.7.Governmental Authorizations, Etc.  No consent, approval or authorization of, or registration, filing or declaration with, any Governmental Authority is required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by the Company of this Agreement or the Notes.
Section 5.8.Litigation; Observance of Agreements, Statutes and Orders.  (a) Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.8, there are no actions, suits, investigations or proceedings pending or, to the best knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting the Company or any Subsidiary or any property of the Company or any Subsidiary in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any Governmental Authority that could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
(b)Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is (i) in default under any agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it is bound, (ii) in violation of any order, judgment, decree or ruling of any court, any arbitrator of any kind or any Governmental Authority or (iii) in violation of any applicable law, ordinance, rule or regulation of any Governmental Authority (including Environmental Laws, the USA PATRIOT Act or any of the other laws and regulations that are referred to in Section 5.16), which default or violation could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Section 5.9.Taxes.  The Company and its Subsidiaries have filed all tax returns that are required to have been filed in any jurisdiction, and have paid all taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other taxes and assessments levied upon them or their properties, assets, income or franchises, to the extent such taxes and assessments have become due and payable and

-6-

AMERCO Note Purchase Agreement
 
before they have become delinquent, except for any taxes and assessments (i) the amount of which, individually or in the aggregate, is not Material or (ii) the amount, applicability or validity of which is currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which the Company or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, has established adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP.  The Company knows of no basis for any other tax or assessment that could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of U.S. federal, state or other taxes for all fiscal periods are adequate.  The U.S. federal income tax liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been finally determined (whether by reason of completed audits or the statute of limitations having run) for all fiscal years up to and including the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020.
Section 5.10.Title to Property; Leases.  The Company and its Subsidiaries have good and sufficient title to their respective properties that individually or in the aggregate are Material, including all such properties reflected in the most recent audited balance sheet referred to in Section 5.5 or purported to have been acquired by the Company or any Subsidiary after such date (except as sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business), in each case free and clear of Liens prohibited by this Agreement.  All leases that individually or in the aggregate are Material are valid and subsisting and are in full force and effect in all material respects.
Section 5.11.Licenses, Permits, Etc.  (a) The Company and its Subsidiaries own or possess all licenses, permits, franchises, authorizations, patents, copyrights, proprietary software, service marks, trademarks and trade names, or rights thereto, that individually or in the aggregate are Material, without known conflict with the rights of others.
(b)To the best knowledge of the Company, no product or service of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries infringes in any material respect any license, permit, franchise, authorization, patent, copyright, proprietary software, service mark, trademark, trade name or other right owned by any other Person.
(c)To the best knowledge of the Company, there is no Material violation by any Person of any right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any license, permit, franchise, authorization, patent, copyright, proprietary software, service mark, trademark, trade name or other right owned or used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Section 5.12.Compliance with Employee Benefit Plans.  (a) The Company and each ERISA Affiliate have operated and administered each Plan in compliance with all applicable laws except for such instances of noncompliance as have not resulted in and could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.  Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability pursuant to Title I or IV of ERISA or the penalty or excise tax provisions of the Code relating to employee benefit plans (as defined in section 3 of ERISA), and no event, transaction or condition has occurred or exists that could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in the incurrence of any such liability by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, or in the imposition of any Lien on any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, in either case pursuant to Title I or IV of ERISA or to section 430(k) of the Code or to any such penalty or excise tax provisions

-7-

AMERCO Note Purchase Agreement
 
under the Code or federal law or section 4068 of ERISA or by the granting of a security interest in connection with the amendment of a Plan, other than such liabilities or Liens as would not be individually or in the aggregate Material.
(b)The present value of the aggregate benefit liabilities under each of the Plans (other than Multiemployer Plans), determined as of the end of such Plan’s most recently ended plan year on the basis of the actuarial assumptions specified for funding purposes in such Plan’s most recent actuarial valuation report, did not exceed the aggregate current value of the assets of such Plan allocable to such benefit liabilities.  The present value of the accrued benefit liabilities (whether or not vested) under each Non‑U.S. Plan that is funded, determined as of the end of the Company’s most recently ended fiscal year on the basis of reasonable actuarial assumptions, did not exceed the current value of the assets of such Non‑U.S. Plan allocable to such benefit liabilities.  The term “benefit liabilities” has the meaning specified in section 4001 of ERISA and the terms “current value” and “present value” have the meaning specified in section 3 of ERISA.
(c)The Company and its ERISA Affiliates have not incurred (i) withdrawal liabilities (and are not subject to contingent withdrawal liabilities) under section 4201 or 4204 of ERISA in respect of Multiemployer Plans that individually or in the aggregate are Material or (ii) any obligation in connection with the termination of or withdrawal from any Non‑U.S. Plan that individually or in the aggregate are Material.
(d)The expected postretirement benefit obligation (determined as of the last day of the Company’s most recently ended fiscal year in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 715‑60, without regard to liabilities attributable to continuation coverage mandated by section 4980B of the Code) of the Company and its Subsidiaries is not Material.
(e)The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the issuance and sale of the Notes hereunder will not involve any transaction that is subject to the prohibitions of section 406 of ERISA or in connection with which a tax could be imposed pursuant to section 4975(c)(1)(A)‑(D) of the Code.  The representation by the Company to each Purchaser in the first sentence of this Section 5.12(e) is made in reliance upon and subject to the accuracy of such Purchaser’s representation in Section 6.2 as to the sources of the funds to be used to pay the purchase price of the Notes to be purchased by such Purchaser.

“Reinvestment Yield” means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the sum of (a) 0.50% plus (b) the yield to maturity implied by the “Ask Yield(s)” reported as of 10:00 a.m.

(New York City time) on the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, on the display designated as “Page PX1” (or such other display as may replace Page PX1) on Bloomberg Financial Markets for the most recently issued actively traded on‑the‑run U.S. Treasury securities (“Reported”) having a maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date.  If there are no such U.S. Treasury securities Reported having a maturity equal to such Remaining Average Life, then such implied yield to maturity will be determined by (i) converting U.S. Treasury bill quotations to bond equivalent yields in accordance with accepted financial practice and (ii) interpolating linearly between the “Ask Yields” Reported for the applicable most recently issued actively traded on‑the‑run U.S. Treasury securities with the maturities (1) closest to and greater than such Remaining Average Life and (2) closest to and less than such Remaining Average Life.  The Reinvestment Yield shall be rounded to the number of decimal places as appears in the interest rate of the applicable Note. 
If such yields are not Reported or the yields Reported as of such time are not ascertainable (including by way of interpolation), then “Reinvestment Yield” means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the sum of (x) 0.50% plus (y) the yield to maturity implied by the U.S. Treasury constant maturity yields reported, for the latest day for which such yields have been so reported as of the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (or any comparable successor publication) for the U.S. Treasury constant maturity having a term equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date.  If there is no such U.S. Treasury constant maturity having a term equal to such Remaining Average Life, such implied yield to maturity will be determined by interpolating linearly between (1) the U.S. Treasury constant maturity so reported with the term closest to and greater than such Remaining Average Life and (2) the U.S. Treasury constant maturity so reported with the term closest to and less than such Remaining Average Life.  The Reinvestment Yield shall be rounded to the number of decimal places as appears in the interest rate of the applicable Note.
“Remaining Average Life” means, with respect to any Called Principal, the number of years obtained by dividing (i) such Called Principal into (ii) the sum of the products obtained by multiplying (a) the principal component of each Remaining Scheduled Payment with respect to such Called Principal by (b) the number of years, computed on the basis of a 360‑day year comprised of twelve 30‑day months and calculated to two decimal places, that will elapse between the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal and the scheduled due date of such Remaining Scheduled Payment.
“Remaining Scheduled Payments” means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, all payments of such Called Principal and interest thereon that would be due after the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal if no payment of such Called Principal were made prior to its scheduled due date, provided that if such Settlement Date is not a date on which interest payments are due to be made under the Notes, then the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued to such Settlement Date and required to be paid on such Settlement Date pursuant to Section 8.2 or Section 12.1.

-20-

AMERCO Note Purchase Agreement
 
“Settlement Date” means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the date on which such Called Principal is to be prepaid pursuant to Section 8.2 or has become or is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 12.1, as the context requires.
Section 8.7.Payments Due on Non‑Business Days.  Anything in this Agreement or the Notes to the contrary notwithstanding, (x) except as set forth in clause (y), any payment of interest on any Note that is due on a date that is not a Business Day shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day without including the additional days elapsed in the computation of the interest payable on such next succeeding Business Day; and (y) any payment of principal of or Make‑Whole Amount on any Note (including principal due on the Maturity Date of such Note) that is due on a date that is not a Business Day shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and shall include the additional days elapsed in the computation of interest payable on such next succeeding Business Day.

(a)Notice of Change in Control.  The Company will, within five Business Days after any Responsible Officer has knowledge of the occurrence of any Change in Control, give written notice of such Change in Control to each holder of Notes.  Such notice shall contain and constitute an offer to prepay Notes as described in subparagraph (b) of this Section 8.8 and shall be accompanied by the certificate described in subparagraph (e) of this Section 8.8.
(b) Offer to Prepay Notes.  The offer to prepay Notes contemplated by subparagraph (a) of this Section 8.8 shall be an offer to prepay, in accordance with and subject to this Section 8.8, all, but not less than all, the Notes held by each holder (in this case only, “holder” in respect of any Note registered in the name of a nominee for a disclosed beneficial owner shall mean such beneficial owner) on a date specified in such offer (the “Proposed Prepayment Date”) which shall be a Business Day.  Such date shall be not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days after the Change in Control.
(c)Acceptance/Rejection.  A holder of Notes may accept the offer to prepay made pursuant to this Section 8.8 by causing a notice of such acceptance to be delivered to the Company not later than 15 days after receipt by such holder of the most recent offer of prepayment.  A failure by a holder of Notes to respond to an offer to prepay made pursuant to this Section 8.8 shall be deemed to constitute a rejection of such offer by such holder.
(d)Prepayment.  Prepayment of the Notes to be prepaid pursuant to this Section 8.8 shall be at 100% of the principal amount of such Notes, together with interest on such Notes accrued to the date of prepayment, but without the Make-Whole Amount or other premium.  The prepayment shall be made on the Proposed Prepayment Date.
(e)Officer’s Certificate.  Each offer to prepay the Notes pursuant to this Section 8.8 shall be accompanied by a certificate, executed by a Senior Financial Officer of the Company and dated the date of such offer, specifying: (i) the Proposed Prepayment Date; (ii) that such offer is made pursuant to this Section 8.8; (iii) the principal amount of each Note offered to be prepaid which shall be 100% of the principal amount thereof; (iv) the interest that would be due on each Note

offered to be prepaid, accrued to the Proposed Prepayment Date; (v) that the conditions of this Section 8.8 have been fulfilled; and (vi) in reasonable detail, the nature and date or proposed date of the Change in Control.
(f)Certain Definitions.  “Change in Control” shall be deemed to have occurred if (a) any “person” or “group” (within the meaning of Section 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act), other than Permitted Holders, becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of 50%, or more, of the Stock of the Company having the right to vote for the election of members of the Board of Directors of the Company, or (b) a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company do not constitute Continuing Directors.
(g)All calculations contemplated in this Section 8.8 involving the capital stock of any Person shall be made with the assumption that all convertible Securities of such Person then outstanding and all convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise of any warrants, options and other rights outstanding at such time were converted at such time and that all options, warrants and similar rights to acquire shares of capital stock of such Person were exercised at such time.

The Company acknowledges, and the parties hereto agree, that each holder of a Note has the right to maintain its investment in the Notes free from repayment by the Company (except as herein specifically provided for) and that the provision for payment of a Make‑Whole Amount by the Company in the event that the Notes are prepaid or are accelerated as a result of an Event of Default, is intended to provide compensation for the deprivation of such right under such circumstances.

Each holder of a Note, by its acceptance of a Note, will be deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to be entitled to the benefits of this Section 20 as though it were a party to this Agreement.  On reasonable request by the Company in connection with the delivery to any holder of a Note of information required to be delivered to such holder under this Agreement or requested by such holder (other than a holder that is a party to this Agreement or its nominee), such holder will enter into an agreement with the Company embodying this Section 20.

Upon receipt of such notice, any reference to such Purchaser in this Agreement (other than in this Section 21), shall be deemed to refer to such Substitute Purchaser in lieu of such original Purchaser.  In the event that such Substitute Purchaser is so substituted as a Purchaser hereunder and such Substitute Purchaser thereafter transfers to such original Purchaser all of the Notes then held by such Substitute Purchaser, upon receipt by the Company of notice of such transfer, any reference to such Substitute Purchaser as a “Purchaser” in this Agreement (other than in this Section 21), shall no longer be deemed to refer to such Substitute Purchaser, but shall refer to such original Purchaser, and such original Purchaser shall again have all the rights of an original holder of the Notes under this Agreement.
Section 22.Miscellaneous.
Section 22.1.Successors and Assigns.

Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall (to the full extent permitted by law) not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
Section 22.4.Construction, Etc.

Guaranty Agreement
This Guaranty Agreement, dated as of [_______________], 2021 (this “Guaranty Agreement”), is made by each of the undersigned (each a “Guarantor” and, together with each of the other signatories hereto and any other entities from time to time parties hereto pursuant to Section 13.1 hereof, the “Guarantors”) in favor of the Purchasers (as defined below) and the other holders from time to time of the Notes (as defined below).  The Purchasers and such other holders are herein collectively called the “holders” and individually a “holder.”
Preliminary Statements:
I.Amerco, a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), has entered into a Note Purchase Agreement dated as of September 29, 2021 (as amended, modified, supplemented or restated from time to time, the “Note Agreement”) with the Persons listed on the signature pages thereto (the “Purchasers”). Capitalized terms used herein have the meanings specified in the Note Agreement unless otherwise defined  herein. 
II.The Company has authorized the issuance, pursuant to the Note Agreement, of (i) 2.43% Senior Notes, Series A due September 30, 2029 in the aggregate principal amount of $150,000,000 (the “Series A Notes”), (ii) 2.51% Senior Notes, Series B due September 30, 2030 in the aggregate principal amount of $150,000,000 (the “Series B Notes”), (iii) 2.63% Senior Notes, Series C due September 30, 2031 in the aggregate principal amount of $150,000,000 (the “Series C Notes”) and (iv) 2.78% Senior Notes, Series D due September 30, 2033 in the aggregate principal amount of $150,000,000 (the “Series D Notes”, together with the Series A Notes, the Series B Notes and the Series C Notes, the “Notes”).  Pursuant to the Note Agreement, the Company proposes to issue and sell (i) $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2.43% Senior Notes, Series A due September 30, 2029, (ii) $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2.51% Senior Notes, Series B due September 30, 2030, (iii) $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2.63% Senior Notes, Series C due September 30, 2031 and (iv) 150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2.78% Senior Notes, Series D due September 30, 2033 (the “Initial Notes”).  The Initial Notes and any other Notes that may from time to time be issued pursuant to the Note Agreement (including any notes issued in substitution for any of the Notes) are herein collectively called the “Notes” and individually a “Note.” 
III.Pursuant to the Note Agreement, the Company is required to cause each Guarantor to deliver this Guaranty Agreement.
IV.Each Guarantor will receive direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by the Note Agreement. The Board of Directors of each Guarantor has determined that the incurrence of such obligations is in the best interests of such Guarantor. 
Now Therefore, in compliance with the Note Agreement, and in consideration of, the execution and delivery of the Note Agreement and the purchase of the Notes by each of the


 
Purchasers, each Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees with, and represents and warrants to each of the holders as follows:
Section 1.Guaranty. 
Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably, unconditionally and jointly and severally with the other Guarantors guarantees to each holder, the due and punctual payment in full of (a) the principal of, Make‑Whole Amount, if any, and interest on (including, without limitation, interest accruing after the filing of any petition in bankruptcy, or the commencement of any insolvency, reorganization or like proceeding, whether or not a claim for post‑filing or post‑petition interest is allowed in such proceeding), and any other amounts due under, the Notes when and as the same shall become due and payable (whether at stated maturity or by required or optional prepayment or by acceleration or otherwise) and (b) any other sums which may become due under the terms and provisions of the Notes, the Note Agreement or any other instrument referred to therein) all such obligations described in clauses (a) and (b) above are herein called the “Guaranteed Obligations”).  The guaranty in the preceding sentence is an absolute, present and continuing guaranty of payment and not of collectability and is in no way conditional or contingent upon any attempt to collect from the Company or any other guarantor of the Notes (including, without limitation, any other Guarantor hereunder) or upon any other action, occurrence or circumstance whatsoever.  In the event that the Company shall fail so to pay any of such Guaranteed Obligations, each Guarantor agrees to pay the same when due to the holders entitled thereto, without demand, presentment, protest or notice of any kind, in lawful money of the United States of America, pursuant to the requirements for payment specified in the Notes and the Note Agreement.  Each default in payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall give rise to a separate cause of action hereunder and separate suits may be brought hereunder as each cause of action arises.  Each Guarantor agrees that the Notes issued in connection with the Note Agreement may (but need not) make reference to this Guaranty Agreement. 
Each Guarantor agrees to pay and to indemnify and save each holder harmless from and against any damage, loss, cost or expense (including attorneys’ fees) which such holder may incur or be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of (x) any breach by such Guarantor, by any other Guarantor or by the Company of any warranty, covenant, term or condition in, or the occurrence of any default under, this Guaranty Agreement, the Notes, the Note Agreement or any other instrument referred to therein, together with all expenses resulting from the compromise or defense of any claims or liabilities arising as a result of any such breach or default, (y) any legal action commenced to challenge the validity or enforceability of this Guaranty Agreement, the Notes, the Note Agreement or any other instrument referred to therein and (z) enforcing or defending (or determining whether or how to enforce or defend) the provisions of this Guaranty Agreement. 
Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges and agrees that such Guarantor’s liability hereunder is joint and several with the other Guarantors and any other Person(s) who may guarantee the obligations and Indebtedness under and in respect of the Notes and the Note Agreement. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions or any other provision of this Guaranty Agreement, the Purchasers (on behalf of themselves and their successors and assigns)  and each

2.2-2

 
Guarantor hereby agree that if at any time the Guaranteed Obligations exceed the Maximum Guaranteed Amount determined as of such time with regard to such Guarantor, then this Guaranty Agreement shall be automatically amended to reduce the Guaranteed Obligations to the Maximum Guaranteed Amount.  Such amendment shall not require the written consent of any Guarantor or any holder and shall be deemed to have been automatically consented to by each Guarantor and each holder.  Each Guarantor agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may at any time exceed the Maximum Guaranteed Amount without affecting or impairing the obligation of such Guarantor.  “Maximum Guaranteed Amount” means as of the date of determination with respect to a Guarantor, the lesser of (a) the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations outstanding on such date and (b) the maximum amount that would not render such Guarantor’s liability under this Guaranty Agreement subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (or any successor provision) or any comparable provision of applicable state law.
Section 2.Obligations Absolute. 
The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall be primary, absolute, irrevocable and unconditional, irrespective of the validity or enforceability of the Notes, the Note Agreement or any other instrument referred to therein, shall not be subject to any counterclaim, setoff, deduction or defense based upon any claim such Guarantor may have against the Company or any holder or otherwise, and shall remain in full force and effect without regard to, and shall not be released, discharged or in any way affected by, any circumstance or condition whatsoever (whether or not such Guarantor shall have any knowledge or notice thereof), including, without limitation: (a) any amendment to, modification of, supplement to or restatement of the Notes, the Note Agreement or any other instrument referred to therein (it being agreed that the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall apply to the Notes, the Note Agreement or any such other instrument as so amended, modified, supplemented or restated) or any assignment or transfer of any thereof or of any interest therein, or any furnishing, acceptance or release of any security for the Notes or the addition, substitution or release of any other Guarantor or any other entity or other Person primarily or secondarily liable in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations; (b) any waiver, consent, extension, indulgence or other action or inaction under or in respect of the Notes, the Note Agreement or any other instrument referred to therein; (c) any bankruptcy, insolvency, arrangement, reorganization, readjustment, composition, liquidation or similar proceeding with respect to the Company or its property; (d) any merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor or of the Company into or with any other Person or any sale, lease or transfer of any or all of the assets of any Guarantor or of the Company to any Person; (e) any failure on the part of the Company for any reason to comply with or perform any of the terms of any other agreement with any Guarantor; (f) any failure on the part of any holder to obtain, maintain, register or otherwise perfect any security; or (g) any other event or circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor (whether or not similar to the foregoing), and in any event however material or prejudicial it may be to any Guarantor or to any subrogation, contribution or reimbursement rights any Guarantor may otherwise have.  Each Guarantor covenants that its obligations hereunder will not be discharged except by indefeasible payment in full in cash of all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other obligations hereunder. 

2.2-3

 
Section 3.Waiver. 
Each Guarantor unconditionally waives to the fullest extent permitted by law, (a) notice of acceptance hereof, of any action taken or omitted in reliance hereon and of any default by the Company in the payment of any amounts due under the Notes, the Note Agreement or any other instrument referred to therein, and of any of the matters referred to in Section 2 hereof, (b) all notices which may be required by statute, rule of law or otherwise to preserve any of the rights of any holder against such Guarantor, including, without limitation, presentment to or demand for payment from the Company or any Guarantor with respect to any Note, notice to the Company or to any Guarantor of default or protest for nonpayment or dishonor and the filing of claims with a court in the event of the bankruptcy of the Company, (c) any right to require any holder to enforce, assert or exercise any right, power or remedy including, without limitation, any right, power or remedy conferred in the Note Agreement or the Notes, (d) any requirement for diligence on the part of any holder and (e) any other act or omission or thing or delay in doing any other act or thing which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Guarantor or otherwise operate as a discharge of such Guarantor or in any manner lessen the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder.
Section 4.Obligations Unimpaired.
Each Guarantor authorizes the holders, without notice or demand to such Guarantor or any other Guarantor and without affecting its obligations hereunder, from time to time: (a) to renew, compromise, extend, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment of, all or any part of the Notes, the Note Agreement or any other instrument referred to therein; (b) to change any of the representations, covenants, events of default or any other terms or conditions of or pertaining to the Notes, the Note Agreement or any other instrument referred to therein, including, without limitation, decreases or increases in amounts of principal, rates of interest, the Make‑Whole Amount or any other obligation; (c) to take and hold security for the payment of the Notes, the Note Agreement or any other instrument referred to therein, for the performance of this Guaranty Agreement or otherwise for the Indebtedness guaranteed hereby and to exchange, enforce, waive, subordinate and release any such security; (d) to apply any such security and to direct the order or manner of sale thereof as the holders in their sole discretion may determine; (e) to obtain additional or substitute endorsers or guarantors or release any other Guarantor or any other Person or entity primarily or secondarily liable in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations; (f) to exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Company, any Guarantor or any other Person; and (g) to apply any sums, by whomsoever paid or however realized, to the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other obligations owed hereunder.  The holders shall have no obligation to proceed against any additional or substitute endorsers or guarantors or to pursue or exhaust any security provided by the Company, such Guarantor or any other Guarantor or any other Person or to pursue any other remedy available to the holders. 
If an event permitting the acceleration of the maturity of the principal amount of any Notes shall exist and such acceleration shall at such time be prevented or the right of any holder to receive any payment on account of the Guaranteed Obligations shall at such time be delayed or otherwise affected by reason of the pendency against the Company, any Guarantor or any other guarantors of a case or proceeding under a bankruptcy or insolvency law, such Guarantor agrees that, for

2.2-4

 
purposes of this Guaranty Agreement and its obligations hereunder, the maturity of such principal amount shall be deemed to have been accelerated with the same effect as if the holder thereof had accelerated the same in accordance with the terms of the Note Agreement, and such Guarantor shall forthwith pay such accelerated Guaranteed Obligations. 
Section 5.Subrogation and Subordination. 
(a)Each Guarantor will not exercise any rights which it may have acquired by way of subrogation under this Guaranty Agreement, by any payment made hereunder or otherwise, or accept any payment on account of such subrogation rights, or any rights of reimbursement, contribution or indemnity or any rights or recourse to any security for the Notes or this Guaranty Agreement unless and until all of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash.
(b)Each Guarantor hereby subordinates the payment of all Indebtedness and other obligations of the Company or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations owing to such Guarantor, whether now existing or hereafter arising, including, without limitation, all rights and claims described in clause (a) of this Section 5, to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all of the Guaranteed Obligations.  If the Required Holders so request, any such Indebtedness or other obligations shall be enforced and performance received by such Guarantor as trustee for the holders and the proceeds thereof shall be paid over to the holders promptly, in the form received (together with any necessary endorsements) to be applied to the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, as may be directed by the Required Holders, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of any Guarantor under this Guaranty Agreement. 
(c)If any amount or other payment is made to or accepted by any Guarantor in violation of any of the preceding clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 5, such amount shall be deemed to have been paid to such Guarantor for the benefit of, and held in trust for the benefit of, the holders and shall be paid over to the holders promptly, in the form received (together with any necessary endorsements) to be applied to the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, as may be directed by the Required Holders, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of such Guarantor under this Guaranty Agreement. 
(d)Each Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by the Note Agreement and that its agreements set forth in this Guaranty Agreement (including this Section 5) are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits. 
(e)Each Guarantor hereby agrees that, to the extent that a Guarantor shall have paid an amount hereunder to any holder that is greater than the net value of the benefits received, directly or indirectly, by such paying Guarantor as a result of the issuance and sale of the Notes (such net value, its “Proportionate Share”), such paying Guarantor shall, subject to Section 5(a) and 5(b), be entitled to contribution from any Guarantor that has not paid its Proportionate Share of the Guaranteed Obligations.  Any amount payable as a contribution under this Section 5(e) shall be determined as of the date on which the related payment is made by such Guarantor seeking contribution and each Guarantor acknowledges that the right to contribution hereunder shall

2.2-5

 
constitute an asset of such Guarantor to which such contribution is owed.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 5(e) shall in no respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor to the holders of the Notes hereunder or under the Notes, the Note Agreement or any other document, instrument or agreement executed in connection therewith, and each Guarantor shall remain jointly and severally liable for the full payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations. 
Section 6.Reinstatement of Guaranty. 
This Guaranty Agreement shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if and to the extent at any time payment, in whole or in part, of any of the sums due to any holder on account of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by a holder upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the Company or any other guarantors, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a custodian, receiver, trustee or other officer with similar powers with respect to the Company or any other guarantors or any part of its or their property, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made. 
Section 7.Rank of Guaranty.
Each Guarantor will ensure that its payment obligations under this Guaranty Agreement will at all times rank at least pari passu, without preference or priority, with all other unsecured and unsubordinated Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor now or hereafter existing.

Each Guarantor represents and warrants to each holder as follows:

Section 11.Amendment and Waiver
Section 11.1.Requirements.  Except as otherwise provided in the fourth paragraph of Section 1 of this Guaranty Agreement, this Guaranty Agreement may be amended, and the observance of any term hereof may be waived (either retroactively or prospectively), with (and only with) the written consent of each Guarantor and the Required Holders, except that no amendment or waiver (a) of any of the first three paragraphs of Section 1 or any of the provisions of Section 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, or 11 hereof, or any defined term (as it is used therein), or (b) which results in the limitation of the liability of any Guarantor hereunder (except to the extent provided in the fourth paragraph of Section 1 of this Guaranty Agreement) will be effective as to any holder unless consented to by such holder in writing. 
Section 11.2.Solicitation of Holders of Notes.
(a)Solicitation.  Each Guarantor will provide each holder of the Notes (irrespective of the amount of Notes then owned by it) with sufficient information, sufficiently far in advance of the date a decision is required, to enable such holder to make an informed and considered decision with respect to any proposed amendment, waiver or consent in respect of any of the provisions hereof.  Each Guarantor will deliver executed or true and correct copies of each amendment, waiver or consent effected pursuant to the provisions of this Section 11.2 to each holder promptly following the date on which it is executed and delivered by, or receives the consent or approval of, the requisite holders of Notes. 
(b)Payment.  The Guarantors will not directly or indirectly pay or cause to be paid any remuneration, whether by way of supplemental or additional interest, fee or otherwise, or grant any security or provide other credit support, to any holder as consideration for or as an inducement to the entering into by any holder of any waiver or amendment of any of the terms and provisions hereof unless such remuneration is concurrently paid, or security is concurrently granted or other credit support concurrently provided, on the same terms, ratably to each holder even if such holder did not consent to such waiver or amendment. 

2.2-8

 
Section 11.3.Binding Effect.  Any amendment or waiver consented to as provided in this Section 11 applies equally to all holders and is binding upon them and upon each future holder and upon each Guarantor without regard to whether any Note has been marked to indicate such amendment or waiver.  No such amendment or waiver will extend to or affect any obligation, covenant or agreement not expressly amended or waived or impair any right consequent thereon.  No course of dealing between a Guarantor and the holder nor any delay in exercising any rights hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver of any rights of any holder.  As used herein, the term “this Guaranty Agreement” and references thereto shall mean this Guaranty Agreement as it may be amended, modified, supplemented or restated from time to time. 
Section 11.4.Notes Held by Company, Etc.  Solely for the purpose of determining whether the holders of the requisite percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding approved or consented to any amendment, waiver or consent to be given under this Guaranty Agreement, or have directed the taking of any action provided herein to be taken upon the direction of the holders of a specified percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding, Notes directly or indirectly owned by any Guarantor, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates shall be deemed not to be outstanding. 
Section 12.Notices. 
All notices and communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing and sent (a) by telecopy if the sender on the same day sends a confirming copy of such notice by a recognized overnight delivery service (charges prepaid), or (b) by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested (postage prepaid), or (c) by a recognized overnight delivery service (with charges prepaid).  Any such notice must be sent:
(a)if to any Guarantor, to [__________________________________][2], or such other address as such Guarantor shall have specified to the holders in writing, or
(b)if to any holder, to such holder at the addresses specified for such communications set forth in Schedule A to the Note Agreement, or such other address as such holder shall have specified to the Guarantors in writing.
Section 13.Miscellaneous. 
Section 13.1.Successors and Assigns; Joinder.  All covenants and other agreements contained in this Guaranty Agreement by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto bind and inure to the benefit of their respective successors and assigns whether so expressed or not.  It is agreed and understood that any Person may become a Guarantor hereunder by executing a Guarantor Supplement substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto and delivering the same to the

2.2-9

 
Holders.  Any such Person shall thereafter be a “Guarantor” for all purposes under this Guaranty Agreement. 
Section 13.2.Severability.  Any provision of this Guaranty Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall (to the full extent permitted by law), not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. 
Section 13.3.Construction.  Each covenant contained herein shall be construed (absent express provision to the contrary) as being independent of each other covenant contained herein, so that compliance with any one covenant shall not (absent such express contrary provision) be deemed to excuse compliance with any other covenant.  Whether any provision herein refers to action to be taken by any Person, or which such Person is prohibited from taking, such provision shall be applicable whether such action is taken directly or indirectly by such Person.

  Related Party Transactions
As set forth in the Company’s Audit Committee Charter and consistent with NASDAQ Listing Rules, our Audit Committee (the “Audit Committee”) reviews and maintains oversight over related party transactions, which are required to be disclosed under the SEC rules and regulations and in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, all such related party transactions are submitted to the Audit Committee for ongoing review and oversight. Our internal processes are designed to ensure that our legal and finance departments identify and monitor potential related party transactions that may require disclosure and Audit Committee oversight.
AMERCO has engaged in related party transactions and has continuing related party interests with certain major stockholders, directors and officers of the consolidated group as disclosed below.
SAC Holding Corporation and SAC Holding II Corporation (collectively “SAC Holdings”) were established in order to acquire and develop self-storage properties. These properties are being managed by us pursuant to management agreements.  SAC Holdings, Four SAC Self-Storage Corporation, Five SAC Self-Storage Corporation, Galaxy Investments, L.P. and 2015 SAC Self-Storage, LLC are substantially controlled by Blackwater Investments, Inc. (“Blackwater”). Blackwater is wholly owned by Willow Grove Holdings LP, which is owned by Mark V. Shoen (a significant stockholder), and various trusts associated with Edward J. Shoen (our Chairman of the Board, President and a significant stockholder) and Mark V. Shoen.

  We currently manage the self-storage properties owned or leased by Blackwater and Mercury Partners, L.P. (“Mercury”), pursuant to a standard form of management agreement, under which we receive a management fee of between 4% and 10% of the gross receipts plus reimbursement for certain expenses. We received management fees, exclusive of reimbursed expenses, of $31.2 million, $29.0 million and $30.0 million from the above-mentioned entities during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This management fee is consistent with the fee received for other properties we previously managed for third parties. Mark V. Shoen controls the general partner of Mercury. The limited partner interests of Mercury are owned indirectly by James P. Shoen and various trusts benefitting Edward J. Shoen and James P. Shoen or their descendants.  Mercury holds the option to purchase a portfolio of properties currently leased by Mercury and a U-Haul subsidiary, which option is exercisable in 2024.

  We lease space for marketing company offices, vehicle repair shops and hitch installation centers from subsidiaries of Blackwater. The terms of the leases are similar to the terms of leases for other properties owned by unrelated parties that are leased to us.
As of March 31, 2021, subsidiaries of Blackwater acted as U-Haul independent dealers. The financial and other terms of the dealership contracts with the aforementioned companies and their subsidiaries are substantially identical to the terms of those with our other independent dealers whereby commissions are paid by us based upon equipment rental revenues.
These agreements and notes with subsidiaries of Blackwater, excluding Dealer Agreements, provided revenues of $25.5 million, expenses of $2.6 million and cash flows of $22.6 million during fiscal 2021. Revenues and commission expenses related to the Dealer Agreements were $323.8 million and $69.2 million, respectively for fiscal 2021.
In June 2020, we purchased an airplane from SAC Holdings for $0.4 million.
In December 2020, AMERCO contributed $12.0 million to Oxford in the form of a surplus note with an interest rate of 4.0%. This note will be repaid to AMERCO with interest over the next seven years.
Management determined that we do not have a variable interest pursuant to the VIE model under ASC 810 in the holding entities of Blackwater.
