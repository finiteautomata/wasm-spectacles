Nothing herein shall be deemed to entitle the Borrower or any other Loan Party to a consent to, or a waiver, amendment, modification or other change of, any of the terms, conditions, obligations, covenants or agreements contained in the Amended Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document in similar or different circumstances.
(c)On and after the First Amendment Effective Date, each reference in the Amended Credit Agreement to “this Agreement”, “hereunder”, “hereof”, “herein” or words of like import, and each reference to the “Credit Agreement”, “thereunder”, “thereof”, “therein” or words of like import (in each case, if referring to the Existing Credit Agreement) in any other Loan Document, shall be deemed a reference to the Amended Credit Agreement. The Borrower and the other parties hereto acknowledge and agree that this Amendment Agreement shall constitute a Loan Document for all purposes of the Existing Credit Agreement, the Amended Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
