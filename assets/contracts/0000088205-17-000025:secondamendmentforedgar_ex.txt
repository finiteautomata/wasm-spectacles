Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) during the period from the date of any acquisition of any Person in accordance with the terms hereof through the last day of the fiscal quarter of the Parent Borrower in which the acquisition of such Person is consummated only, at the election of the Parent Borrower, all terms of an accounting or financial nature with respect to such Person and its Subsidiaries shall be construed in accordance with the accounting standards applicable to such Person and its Subsidiaries, as in effect during such time period, and (b) leases shall continue to be classified and accounted for on a basis consistent with that reflected in the audited financial statements referred to in Section 3.4(a) for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding any change in GAAP relating thereto, unless the parties hereto shall enter into a mutually acceptable amendment addressing such changes, as provided for above. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in connection with any Qualified Acquisition Pro Forma Calculation, the maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio that was permitted pursuant to Section 6.1(a) for the most recent fiscal quarter ended for which the Parent Borrower was required to deliver financial statements pursuant to Section 5.1(a) or (b) shall be deemed to be 4.00 to 1.0 solely for purposes of such Qualified Acquisition Pro Forma Calculation.
(c)    Article I of the Credit Agreement is amended to add a new Section 1.10 immediately following Section 1.9 of the Credit Agreement to read as follows:
Section 1.10    LIBOR Successor Rate.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the Parent Borrower or Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the Required Lenders, a copy to Parent Borrower) that the Parent Borrower or Required Lenders (as applicable) have determined, that: (a) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR for any requested Interest Period, including because the LIBOR Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or (b) the administrator of the LIBOR Screen Rate or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which LIBOR or the LIBOR Screen Rate shall no longer be made available, or used for determining the interest rate of loans (such specific date, the “Scheduled Unavailability Date”); or (c) syndicated loans currently being executed, or that include language similar to that contained in this Section, are being executed or amended (as applicable) to incorporate or adopt a new benchmark interest rate to replace LIBOR; then, reasonably promptly after such determination by the Administrative Agent or receipt by the Administrative Agent of such notice, as applicable, the Administrative Agent and the Parent Borrower may amend this Agreement to replace LIBOR with an alternate benchmark rate (including any mathematical or other adjustments to the benchmark (if any) incorporated therein) (any such proposed rate, a “LIBOR Successor Rate”), together with any proposed LIBOR Successor Rate Conforming Changes and any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Parent Borrower unless, prior to such time, Lenders

15


comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders do not accept such amendment.
If no LIBOR Successor Rate has been determined and the circumstances under clause (a) above exist or the Scheduled Unavailability Date has occurred (as applicable), the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Parent Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (i) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Loans or Interest Periods), and (ii) the Eurocurrency Rate component shall no longer be utilized in determining the Alternate Base Rate. Upon receipt of such notice, the Parent Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Loans (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a borrowing of ABR Loans (subject to the foregoing clause (ii)) in the amount specified therein.
Notwithstanding anything else herein, any definition of LIBOR Successor Rate shall provide that in no event shall such LIBOR Successor Rate be less than zero for purposes of this Agreement.
(d)    The first two paragraphs set forth in Section 2.1(b) of the Credit Agreement are amended and restated in their entirety to read as follows:
(b)    The Parent Borrower and any one or more Lenders may from time to time agree that such Lenders (or any other additional bank, financial institution or other entity which becomes a Lender pursuant to this Section 2.1(b)) shall add one or more term loan facilities (the loans thereunder, the “Incremental Term Loans”) and/or increase the Commitments in respect of any of the Facilities by executing and delivering to the Administrative Agent and, in the case of any increase in the Participation FCI Commitments, the Foreign Trade Facility Agent, an Incremental Facility Activation Notice specifying (i) the amount of such Incremental Term Loans and/or Commitment increase, and (ii) in the case of any Incremental Term Loans, (A) the applicable Incremental Term Loan Maturity Date, (B) the amortization schedule for such Incremental Term Loans, which shall comply with Section 2.11(a), (C) the Applicable Rate (and/or other pricing terms) for such Incremental Term Loans and (D) the requested currency (which may be in Dollars or any Alternative Currency); provided that (1) the aggregate principal amount of borrowings of Incremental Term Loans outstanding at any time and Commitment increases pursuant to this subsection (b) in effect at any time shall not exceed, as of any date of determination, (x) an amount equal to the greater of (I) $200,000,000, and (II) the amount of Consolidated EBITDA for the period of four fiscal quarters most recently ended on or prior to such date for which the Parent Borrower has delivered financial statements pursuant to Section 5.1(a) or (b) and a Compliance Certificate pursuant to Section 5.1(c) (such amount, the “Incremental Basket Amount”), plus (y) an amount equal to all voluntary prepayments of the Term Loans made pursuant to Section 2.12(a), all voluntary prepayments of the Domestic Revolving Loans made pursuant to Section 2.12(a) (to the extent accompanied by a permanent reduction in the aggregate Domestic Revolving Commitments), and all voluntary prepayments of the Global Revolving Loans made pursuant to Section 2.12(a) (to the extent accompanied by a permanent reduction in the aggregate Global Revolving Commitments), in each case, (I) to the extent such voluntary prepayments are made prior to such date, and (II) excluding any such voluntary prepayments that are funded with the proceeds of incurrences of long-term Indebtedness (such amount, together with the Incremental Basket Amount, the “Fixed Incremental Amount”; it being understood that, for the avoidance of doubt, the amount of any Incremental Term

16


Loans and/or any increases in the Commitments incurred in reliance on the Fixed Incremental Amount shall reduce the Fixed Incremental Amount), plus (z) an unlimited amount, so long as, immediately after giving effect to the incurrence of any such Incremental Term Loans and/or the establishment of any such increase in the Commitments (tested solely on the date of funding of any such Incremental Term Loan and/or establishment of any increase in the Commitments as set forth in the Incremental Facility Activation Notice and not any time thereafter, and assuming for such purposes that such Incremental Term Loan is fully drawn and/or such Commitment increase is fully drawn) on a pro forma basis, the Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (or, following the Release Date, the Consolidated Leverage Ratio), as of the last day of the fiscal quarter of the Parent Borrower most recently ended for which the Parent Borrower has delivered financial statements pursuant to Section 5.1(a) or (b), shall not be greater than 2.75 to 1.0 (the “Ratio Incremental Amount”); (2) no Default or Event of Default shall be in existence or would be caused by the incurrence of such Incremental Term Loans and/or establishment of such increase in the Commitments; and (3) after giving effect to incurrence of any Incremental Term Loans and/or establishment of any increase in the Commitments on a pro forma basis (and assuming for such purposes that such Incremental Term Loans are fully drawn and/or such Commitment increase is fully drawn), the Parent Borrower would be in compliance with the financial covenants contained in Section 6.1 as of the last day of the fiscal quarter of the Parent Borrower most recently ended for which the Parent Borrower has delivered financial statements pursuant to Section 5.1(a) or (b). It is understood and agreed that the Parent Borrower may first incur any Incremental Term Loan and/or establish any increase to the Commitments in reliance on the Ratio Incremental Amount prior to incurring Incremental Term Loans and/or establishing increases to the Commitments in reliance on the Fixed Incremental Amount. If the Bilateral FCI Issuing Commitment is increased, subject to Section 2.6(u), the Parent Borrower shall have the option of transferring existing FCIs from the Participation FCI Issuing Commitment to the Bilateral FCI Issuing Commitment. In the case of any increase in the Commitments under any Facility (other than any Incremental Term Loan Facility), the terms applicable to such increased Commitments and the Loans thereunder shall be the same as the terms applicable to the Facility being so increased. In the case of any increase of the Domestic Revolving Facility or the Global Revolving Facility, any new Lender added in connection with such increase must be reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Lenders (but not the Domestic Revolving Lenders or Global Revolving Lenders, as applicable). In the case of any increase of the Foreign Trade Facility, any new Lender added in connection with such increase must be reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, the Foreign Trade Facility Agent and the applicable FCI Issuing Lenders (but not the Lenders with Participation FCI Commitments). No Lender shall have any obligation to participate in any Incremental Term Loan or other increase described in this paragraph unless it agrees to do so in its sole discretion. Any additional bank, financial institution or other entity which, with the consent of the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and, if applicable, the Foreign Trade Facility Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), elects to become a “Lender” under this Agreement in connection with the making of any Incremental Term Loan or the making of any additional Commitment shall execute a New Lender Supplement, whereupon such bank, financial institution or other entity shall become a Lender for all purposes and to the same extent as if originally a party hereto and shall be bound by and entitled to the benefits of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the proceeds of any Incremental Term Loan are being used to finance a Limited Condition Acquisition, and the Parent Borrower has obtained binding commitments of Incremental Term Lenders to fund such Incremental Term Loan (“Acquisition Financing Commitments”), then the conditions to the funding and incurrence of such Incremental Term Loan shall be limited as follows, if and to the extent such

17


Incremental Term Lenders so agree with respect to their Acquisition Financing Commitments: (A) the condition set forth in Section 4.3(a) shall apply only with respect to customary “specified representations” approved by the Incremental Term Lenders providing the Acquisition Financing Commitments or if the circumstances giving rise to the failure of such conditions also entitle the Parent Borrower or the applicable Restricted Subsidiaries to terminate its or their obligations under the definitive agreement for such Limited Condition Acquisition (each, an “Acquisition Agreement”), and (B) the reference in Section 4.3(b) to no Default or Event of Default shall mean the absence of a Default or Event of Default at the date such Acquisition Agreement is executed and delivered and the absence of an Event of Default under paragraphs (a), (b), (h), (i) or (j) of Article VII at the date the applicable Limited Condition Acquisition is consummated (it being understood that this sentence shall not limit the conditions set forth in Section 4.3 with respect to any proposed Borrowing or the issuance of any Letter of Credit or FCI in connection with such Permitted Acquisition or otherwise). Additionally, and solely for purposes of determining compliance with (x) clause (3) in the first proviso of the preceding paragraph, or (y) compliance with the Ratio Incremental Amount, in each case in connection with the incurrence of any Incremental Term Loan used to finance all or any part of a Limited Condition Acquisition, at the Parent Borrower’s option, the date for purposes of determining such compliance shall be the date on which the Acquisition Agreement for such Limited Condition Acquisition is executed and delivered; provided that if the Parent Borrower shall elect to determine such compliance on the date on which such Acquisition Agreement is executed and delivered, during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of such Acquisition Agreement and ending on the earlier to occur of (i) the date of consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition, and (ii) the date of abandonment by the Parent Borrower or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary of such Limited Condition Acquisition, each calculation on a pro forma basis required hereunder shall demonstrate two calculations of each of the relevant covenants set forth in Section 6.1, the first assuming that such Limited Condition Acquisition (and all transactions in connection therewith, including the incurrence of any Incremental Term Loan or any Commitment increase) has been consummated and the second assuming that such transaction has been abandoned, and, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any particular transaction for which pro forma compliance is required, each such calculation must demonstrate compliance on a pro forma basis in order for such transaction to be permitted. Nothing in the foregoing constitutes a waiver of any Default or Event of Default under this Agreement or of any rights or remedies of Lenders and the Administrative Agent under any provision of the Loan Documents.
(e)    Section 2.1(c) of the Credit Agreement is amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:
(c)    Extension Option for Domestic Revolving Commitments.
(i)    The Parent Borrower may from time to time during the term of this Agreement, by written notice to the Administrative Agent (any such notice being a “Domestic Revolving Extension Notice”), request that each Domestic Revolving Lender extend (any such extension, a “Domestic Revolving Commitment Extension”) the then-existing Domestic Revolving Maturity Date applicable to such Domestic Revolving Lender’s Domestic Revolving Commitment to the extended maturity date specified in such Domestic Revolving Extension Notice (any such extended maturity date, the “Extended Domestic Revolving Maturity Date”). Each Domestic Revolving Extension Notice delivered in connection with any requested Domestic Revolving Commitment Extension shall set forth the date on which such Domestic Revolving Commitment Extension is requested to become effective (such date, the “Domestic Revolving Extension Date”), which date shall be not

18


less than 30 Business Days nor more than 60 Business Days after the date of the Domestic Revolving Extension Notice for such Domestic Revolving Commitment Extension. The Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit any Domestic Revolving Extension Notice to each Domestic Revolving Lender. Each Domestic Revolving Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent whether it wishes to extend the then-existing Domestic Revolving Maturity Date applicable to such Domestic Revolving Lender’s Domestic Revolving Commitment to the Extended Domestic Revolving Maturity Date specified in the applicable Domestic Revolving Extension Notice for such Domestic Revolving Commitment Extension, such notice to be provided by each Domestic Revolving Lender no later than 15 Business Days prior to the Domestic Revolving Extension Date for such Domestic Revolving Commitment Extension (such date, the “Domestic Revolving Lender Extension Response Date”). The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Parent Borrower of the identity of each Domestic Revolving Lender that has agreed to extend the then-existing Domestic Revolving Maturity Date applicable to such Domestic Revolving Lender’s Domestic Revolving Commitment to the Extended Domestic Revolving Maturity Date specified in the applicable Domestic Revolving Extension Notice for such Domestic Revolving Commitment Extension, and the amount of such Domestic Revolving Lender’s Domestic Revolving Commitment. Any Domestic Revolving Lender which does not expressly notify the Administrative Agent on or before the Domestic Revolving Lender Extension Response Date for such Domestic Revolving Commitment Extension that it wishes to so extend the then-existing Domestic Revolving Maturity Date applicable to such Domestic Revolving Lender’s Domestic Revolving Commitment shall be deemed to have rejected the Parent Borrower’s request for such Domestic Revolving Commitment Extension. Effective as of the Domestic Revolving Extension Date for such Domestic Revolving Commitment Extension, with respect to each Domestic Revolving Lender that has agreed to extend the then-existing Domestic Revolving Maturity Date applicable to such Domestic Revolving Lender’s Domestic Revolving Commitment to the Extended Domestic Revolving Maturity Date specified in the Domestic Revolving Extension Notice for such Domestic Revolving Commitment Extension, the then-existing Domestic Revolving Maturity Date applicable to such Domestic Revolving Lender’s Domestic Revolving Commitment shall be automatically and immediately so extended to the Extended Domestic Revolving Maturity Date specified in the Domestic Revolving Extension Notice for such Domestic Revolving Commitment Extension so long as, as of the Domestic Revolving Extension Date for such Domestic Revolving Commitment Extension, no Default or Event of Default exists or would result after giving effect to such Domestic Revolving Commitment Extension. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no Issuing Lender shall have any obligation to issue Letters of Credit beyond the Domestic Revolving Maturity Date in effect as of the Second Amendment Effective Date, unless such Issuing Lender agrees in writing to issue Letters of Credit until any Extended Domestic Revolving Maturity Date established after the Second Amendment Effective Date.
(ii)    If the then-existing Domestic Revolving Maturity Date applicable to any Domestic Revolving Lender’s Domestic Revolving Commitment shall have been extended in accordance with Section 2.1(c)(i), all references herein to the “Domestic Revolving Maturity Date” applicable to such Domestic Revolving Lender’s Domestic Revolving Commitment shall be a reference to the then-applicable Extended Domestic Revolving Maturity Date applicable to such Domestic Revolving Lender’s Domestic Revolving Commitment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement (but subject to the last sentence of Section 2.1(c)(i) above), in connection with any Domestic

19


Revolving Commitment Extension, the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent may enter into an amendment to this Agreement and/or any other Loan Document (and the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to enter into, and the Lenders agree that this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be amended by, any such amendment) to the extent the Administrative Agent deems necessary in order to (A) reflect the existence and terms of such Domestic Revolving Commitment Extension, (B) make such other changes to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents consistent with the provisions and intent of such Domestic Revolving Commitment Extension, and (C) effect such other amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.1(c). The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of any such amendment.
(iii)    The Parent Borrower shall have the right, following any Domestic Revolving Lender Extension Response Date for any Domestic Revolving Commitment Extension, but prior to the Domestic Revolving Extension Date applicable to such Domestic Revolving Commitment Extension, to replace each Domestic Revolving Lender declining to participate in such Domestic Revolving Commitment Extension with one or more Persons (A) reasonably satisfactory to the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and (B) satisfactory to the Issuing Lenders in their sole discretion (each such Person, an “Additional Domestic Revolving Commitment Lender”), as provided in Section 2.21(b). Each Additional Domestic Revolving Commitment Lender shall have entered into an Assignment and Assumption or such other documentation satisfactory to the Administrative Agent pursuant to which such Additional Domestic Revolving Commitment Lender shall, effective as of the Domestic Revolving Extension Date applicable to such Domestic Revolving Commitment Extension, undertake a Domestic Revolving Commitment (and if any such Additional Domestic Revolving Commitment Lender is already a Lender, its new Domestic Revolving Commitment shall be in addition to any other Commitment of such Lender on such date).
(f)    Section 2.1(d) of the Credit Agreement is amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:
(d)    Extension Option for Global Revolving Commitments.
(i)    The Parent Borrower may from time to time during the term of this Agreement, by written notice to the Administrative Agent (any such notice being a “Global Revolving Extension Notice”), request that each Global Revolving Lender extend (any such extension, a “Global Revolving Commitment Extension”) the then-existing Global Revolving Maturity Date applicable to such Global Revolving Lender’s Global Revolving Commitment to the extended maturity date specified in such Global Revolving Extension Notice (any such extended maturity date, the “Extended Global Revolving Maturity Date”). Each Global Revolving Extension Notice delivered in connection with any requested Global Revolving Commitment Extension shall set forth the date on which such Global Revolving Commitment Extension is requested to become effective (such date, the “Global Revolving Extension Date”), which date shall be not less than 30 Business Days nor more than 60 Business Days after the date of the Global Revolving Extension Notice for such Global Revolving Commitment Extension. The Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit any Global Revolving Extension Notice to each Global Revolving Lender. Each Global

20


Revolving Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent whether it wishes to extend the then-existing Global Revolving Maturity Date applicable to such Global Revolving Lender’s Global Revolving Commitment to the Extended Global Revolving Maturity Date specified in the applicable Global Revolving Extension Notice for such Global Revolving Commitment Extension, such notice to be provided by each Global Revolving Lender no later than 15 Business Days prior to the Global Revolving Extension Date for such Global Revolving Commitment Extension (such date, the “Global Revolving Lender Extension Response Date”). The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Parent Borrower of the identity of each Global Revolving Lender that has agreed to extend the then-existing Global Revolving Maturity Date applicable to such Global Revolving Lender’s Global Revolving Commitment to the Extended Global Revolving Maturity Date specified in the applicable Global Revolving Extension Notice for such Global Revolving Commitment Extension, and the amount of such Global Revolving Lender’s Global Revolving Commitment. Any Global Revolving Lender which does not expressly notify the Administrative Agent on or before the Global Revolving Lender Extension Response Date for such Global Revolving Commitment Extension that it wishes to so extend the then-existing Global Revolving Maturity Date applicable to such Global Revolving Lender’s Global Revolving Commitment shall be deemed to have rejected the Parent Borrower’s request for such Global Revolving Commitment Extension. Effective as of the Global Revolving Extension Date for such Global Revolving Commitment Extension, with respect to each Global Revolving Lender that has agreed to extend the then-existing Global Revolving Maturity Date applicable to such Global Revolving Lender’s Global Revolving Commitment to the Extended Global Revolving Maturity Date specified in the Global Revolving Extension Notice for such Global Revolving Commitment Extension, the then-existing Global Revolving Maturity Date applicable to such Global Revolving Lender’s Global Revolving Commitment shall be automatically and immediately so extended to the Extended Global Revolving Maturity Date specified in the Global Revolving Extension Notice for such Global Revolving Commitment Extension so long as, as of the Global Revolving Extension Date for such Global Revolving Commitment Extension, no Default or Event of Default exists or would result after giving effect to such Global Revolving Commitment Extension. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no Issuing Lender shall have any obligation to issue Letters of Credit beyond the Global Revolving Maturity Date in effect as of the Second Amendment Effective Date, unless such Issuing Lender agrees in writing to issue Letters of Credit until any Extended Global Revolving Maturity Date established after the Second Amendment Effective Date.
(ii)    If the then-existing Global Revolving Maturity Date applicable to any Global Revolving Lender’s Global Revolving Commitment shall have been extended in accordance with Section 2.1(d)(i), all references herein to the “Global Revolving Maturity Date” applicable to such Global Revolving Lender’s Global Revolving Commitment shall be a reference to the then-applicable Extended Global Revolving Maturity Date applicable to such Global Revolving Lender’s Global Revolving Commitment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement (but subject to the last sentence of Section 2.1(d)(i) above), in connection with any Global Revolving Commitment Extension, the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent may enter into an amendment to this Agreement and/or any other Loan Document (and the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to enter into, and the Lenders agree that this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be amended by, any such amendment) to the extent the Administrative Agent deems necessary in order to (A) reflect the existence and terms of such Global

21


Revolving Commitment Extension, (B) make such other changes to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents consistent with the provisions and intent of such Global Revolving Commitment Extension, and (C) effect such other amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.1(d). The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of any such amendment.
(iii)    The Parent Borrower shall have the right, following any Global Revolving Lender Extension Response Date for any Global Revolving Commitment Extension, but prior to the Global Revolving Extension Date applicable to such Global Revolving Commitment Extension, to replace each Global Revolving Lender declining to participate in such Global Revolving Commitment Extension with one or more Persons (A) reasonably satisfactory to the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and (B) satisfactory to the Issuing Lenders in their sole discretion (each such Person, an “Additional Global Revolving Commitment Lender”), as provided in Section 2.21(b). Each Additional Global Revolving Commitment Lender shall have entered into an Assignment and Assumption or such other documentation satisfactory to the Administrative Agent pursuant to which such Additional Global Revolving Commitment Lender shall, effective as of the Global Revolving Extension Date applicable to such Global Revolving Commitment Extension, undertake a Global Revolving Commitment (and if any such Additional Global Revolving Commitment Lender is already a Lender, its new Global Revolving Commitment shall be in addition to any other Commitment of such Lender on such date).
(g)    Section 2.1(e) of the Credit Agreement is amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

The outstanding principal amount of such term loan immediately prior to the Second Amendment Effective Date is THREE HUNDRED TWENTY-EIGHT MILLION ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($328,125,000) (the “Existing Term Loan A”). Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Term Loan A Lender severally has made its portion of a term loan (the “Term Loan A”) to the Parent Borrower in Dollars in an amount equal to such Term Loan A Lender’s Term Loan A Commitment. Each Term Loan A Lender shall make its portion of the Term Loan A to the Parent Borrower by (i) continuing all or any of its portion of the Existing Term Loan A, and/or (ii) advancing an additional borrowing of its portion of the Term Loan A on the Second Amendment Effective Date.

(i)    The reference to “the the” in Section 2.5(d)(i) of the Credit Agreement is amended to read “the”.
(j)    Sections 2.6(b)(i) and (b)(ii) of the Credit Agreement are amended and restated in their entirety to read as follows:
(i)    The Parent Borrower may from time to time during the term of this Agreement, by written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Foreign Trade Facility Agent (such notice being an “Extension Notice”) delivered no later than 60 days prior to the Foreign Trade Maturity Date (the date of such notice, the “Notice Date”), request (x) one or more Lenders with a Participation FCI Commitment and one or more Participation FCI Issuing Lenders and/or (y) one or more Bilateral FCI Issuing Lenders to extend the then applicable Foreign Trade Maturity Date with respect to such Commitment(s) to a later date (such extended date, the “Extended Foreign Trade Maturity Date”). The Foreign Trade Facility Agent shall promptly transmit any Extension Notice to each Lender with a Participation FCI Commitment and each FCI Issuing Lender. Each FCI Issuing Lender and each Lender with a Participation FCI Commitment shall notify the Foreign Trade Facility Agent whether it wishes to extend the then applicable Foreign Trade Maturity Date and, if so, as to which of its Commitments, at least 30 days (or such earlier date as directed by the Parent Borrower) prior to the then applicable Foreign Trade Maturity Date, and any such notice given by an FCI Issuing Lender or a Lender with a Participation FCI Commitment to the Foreign Trade Facility Agent, once given, shall be irrevocable as to such Lender. The Foreign Trade Facility Agent shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Parent Borrower of the notice of each FCI Issuing Lender and each Lender with a Participation FCI Commitment that it wishes to extend (each, an “Extension Acceptance Notice”). Any FCI Issuing Lender and any Lender with a Participation FCI Commitment which does not expressly notify the Foreign Trade Facility Agent on or before the date that is 30 days (or such earlier date as directed by the Parent Borrower) prior to the then applicable Foreign Trade Revolving Maturity Date that it wishes to so extend the then applicable Foreign Trade Maturity Date shall be deemed to have rejected the Parent Borrower’s request for extension of such Foreign Trade Maturity Date with respect to each of its Bilateral FCI Issuing Commitment, Participation FCI Issuing Commitment, or Participation FCI Commitment, as applicable. If (x) one or more Lenders with a Participation FCI Commitment and one or more Participation FCI Issuing Lenders and/or (y) one or more Bilateral FCI Issuing Lenders have elected (in each case in their sole and absolute discretion) to so extend the then applicable Foreign Trade Maturity Date with respect to its specified Commitment(s), the Foreign Trade Facility Agent shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Parent Borrower of such election by such Lenders with a Participation FCI Commitment and/or such FCI Issuing Lenders no later than five Business Days after the date when Extension Acceptance Notices are due, and effective on the date of such notice by the Foreign Trade Facility Agent to the Administrative Agent and the Parent Borrower (the “Extension Date”), the Foreign Trade Maturity Date shall be automatically and immediately so extended as to each such Lender with respect to its specified Commitment(s) to the Extended Foreign Trade Maturity Date. For the avoidance of doubt, if any Lenders with a Participation FCI Commitment, any Participation FCI Issuing Lenders, or any Bilateral FCI Issuing Lenders shall not have elected (in each case in their sole and absolute discretion) or are deemed not to have elected to so extend the then applicable Foreign Trade Maturity Date with respect to one or more of its Commitments, then (x) the non-extended Participation FCI Commitment, Bilateral FCI Issuing Commitment, and/or Participation FCI Issuing Commitment, as applicable, of each such non-extending Lender will be automatically terminated as of the then applicable Foreign Trade Maturity Date (not giving effect to the proposed extension), (y) the aggregate Participation FCI Commitments, Bilateral FCI Issuing Commitments, and Participation FCI Issuing Commitments hereunder, as applicable, shall be reduced as of the then

23


applicable Foreign Trade Maturity Date (not giving effect to the proposed extension) by the amounts of the Participation FCI Commitments, Bilateral FCI Issuing Commitments, and/or Participation FCI Issuing Commitments of each such non-extending Lender, and (z) any participations purchased under this Agreement shall be automatically appropriately adjusted in amount to reflect such changed Commitments as of the then applicable Foreign Trade Maturity Date (not giving effect to the proposed extension). No extension of Participation FCI Commitments and Participation FCI Issuing Commitments will be permitted hereunder unless, after giving effect to the termination of the Participation FCI Commitment, Bilateral FCI Issuing Commitment, and/or Participation FCI Issuing Commitment of any non-extending Lender, as applicable, the total FCI Issuing Lender Exposures with respect to Participation FCIs of all the Participation FCI Issuing Lenders (including those non-extending Participation FCI Issuing Lenders that have not received a Counter-Guarantee to support the outstanding Participation FCIs issued by such non-extending Participation FCI Issuing Lender or, in respect of such outstanding Participation FCIs, the Parent Borrower or other relevant Borrower has not provided Cash Cover (or other credit support) in accordance with Section 2.6(p)(viii)) does not exceed the total Participation FCI Commitments of all the extending Lenders with Participation FCI Commitments. Each outstanding Bilateral FCI and outstanding Participation FCI issued by a non-extending FCI Issuing Lender shall continue to be considered an issued Bilateral FCI or Participation FCI (as applicable) hereunder and part of the FCI Issuing Lender Exposure hereunder unless the Parent Borrower elects in its sole discretion to have a Counter-Guarantee issued hereunder in favor of such non-extending FCI Issuing Lender or the Parent Borrower or other relevant Borrower provides Cash Cover (or other credit support) in accordance with Section 2.6(p)(viii), in each case to support such Bilateral FCIs and Participation FCIs, in which case such Bilateral FCIs and Participation FCIs shall no longer be considered to be Bilateral FCIs or Participation FCIs issued pursuant to this Agreement except that for purposes of Section 2.6(p)(iii), (iv) and (v) and Section 2.6(h) such Bilateral FCIs and Participation FCIs shall continue to be considered as issued pursuant to this Agreement and the Borrowers’ obligations under such Sections with respect to fees, costs, expenses, reimbursement and indemnification obligations shall continue to apply with respect to such Bilateral FCIs and Participation FCIs. On or prior to the then applicable Foreign Trade Maturity Date (not giving effect to the proposed extension), the Parent Borrower shall pay or cause to be paid to each non-extending Lender all amounts owing to such non-extending Lender with respect to its Participation FCI Commitment, Bilateral FCI Issuing Commitment, and/or Participation FCI Issuing Commitment, as applicable, including the repayment of an amount equal to the outstanding funded participations of all FCI Disbursements made by such non-extending Lender or funded FCI Disbursements made by such non-extending FCI Issuing Lender, as applicable, any accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents in connection with such Commitment. Upon the delivery of an Extension Notice and upon the extension of the Foreign Trade Maturity Date pursuant to this Section 2.6(b)(i), the Parent Borrower shall be deemed to have represented and warranted on and as of the Notice Date and the Extension Date, as the case may be, that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no Lender with a Participation FCI Commitment or FCI Issuing Lender shall have any obligation to extend the Foreign Trade Maturity Date, and each Lender with a Participation FCI Commitment and each FCI Issuing Lender may (with respect to its respective Participation FCI Commitment, Bilateral FCI Issuing Commitment and/or Participation FCI Issuing Commitment) at its option, unconditionally and without cause, decline to extend the Foreign Trade Maturity Date.
(ii)    If the Foreign Trade Maturity Date shall have been extended in accordance with Section 2.6(b)(i) with respect to (x) any Participation FCI Commitments and Participation FCI Issuing Commitments and/or (y) any Bilateral FCI Issuing Commitments, then, as to the applicable

“Secured Parties”: the collective reference to the Administrative Agent, the Foreign Trade Facility Agent, the Lenders, in the case of any Hedging Agreement entered into by the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary or any Specified Cash Management Agreement, any Lender or any Affiliate of any Lender counterparty thereto (even if such Person ceases to be a Lender or such Person’s Affiliate ceased to be a Lender; provided that, in the case of a Hedging Agreement with a Person who is no longer a Lender (or Affiliate of a Lender), such Person shall be considered a Secured Party only through the stated termination date (without extension or renewal) of such Hedging Agreement), and in the case of any Specified Loan Document entered into by any Specified Obligations Party with respect to any Specified Obligations, the applicable lender or lenders party thereto (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Person even if such Person ceases to be a Lender or such Person’s Affiliate ceased to be a Lender).

(f)    The following new definition is added to Section 1.1 of the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement in the appropriate alphabetical order to read as follows:
“Specified Obligations Party”: (i) with respect to any secured Indebtedness incurred pursuant to Section 6.2(k) of the Credit Agreement, any Foreign Subsidiary or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Loan Party that has incurred such Indebtedness (but only to the extent the Parent Borrower has delivered to the Administrative Agent, not later than 90 days after the execution and delivery of the documentation relating to such Indebtedness, a Secured Party Designation Notice with respect to such Indebtedness); (ii) with respect to any secured Indebtedness incurred pursuant

33


to Section 6.2(r) of the Credit Agreement, any Foreign Subsidiary that has incurred such Indebtedness (but only to the extent the Parent Borrower has delivered to the Administrative Agent, not later than 90 days after the execution and delivery of the documentation relating to such Indebtedness, a Secured Party Designation Notice with respect to such Indebtedness); and (iii) with respect to any Indebtedness relating to reimbursement and related obligations in connection with letters of credit (which may be financial letters of credit, non-financial letters of credit or commercial letters of credit), bank guarantees or surety instruments incurred pursuant to Section 6.2(j) of the Credit Agreement and provided by any Lender or any Affiliate of any Lender (even if such Person ceases to be a Lender or such Person’s Affiliate ceased to be a Lender), the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary that has incurred such Indebtedness (but only to the extent the Parent Borrower has delivered to the Administrative Agent, not later than 90 days after the execution and delivery of the documentation relating to such Indebtedness, a Secured Party Designation Notice with respect to such Indebtedness).

(a)    Each of the Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally and irrevocably, guarantees to the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns, the prompt and complete payment and performance when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the Borrower Obligations (other than in respect of Excluded Taxes); provided, however, that the Parent Borrower’s guarantee obligations under this Section 2 shall be limited to the guarantee of the prompt and complete payment and performance by each Foreign Subsidiary Borrower and each Subsidiary when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the Borrower Obligations of such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower and/or such Subsidiary (other than in respect of Excluded Taxes); and provided, further, that the obligations of any Guarantor under this Section 2.1 shall exclude any Excluded Swap Obligations with respect to such Guarantor.
(h)    Each reference in the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement to “Subsidiary Loan Document” or “Subsidiary Loan Documents” is amended to read “Specified Loan Document” or “Specified Loan Documents”, as applicable.
(i)    The reference to “Subsidiary Obligations” in Section 6.3 of the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement is amended to read “Specified Obligations”.
