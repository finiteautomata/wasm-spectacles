Section 1.Defined Terms. Each capitalized term used herein but not otherwise defined herein has the meaning given such term in the Credit Agreement, as amended by this First Amendment (unless otherwise indicated). Unless otherwise indicated, all section references in this First Amendment refer to sections of the Credit Agreement.
Section 2.    Amendments to Credit Agreement.
2.1    Amendment to Cover Page. The cover page of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by replacing the reference to “SUNTRUST BANK” with “TRUIST BANK”.

1    


2.2    Amendment to Introductory Paragraph. The introductory paragraph of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by replacing the reference to “SunTrust Bank” with “Truist Bank”.
2.3    Amendments to Section 1.02 – Certain Defined Terms.
(a)    The following definitions are hereby amended and restated in their entirety to read as follows:
“Aggregate Elected Borrowing Base Commitments” means (a) on the First Amendment Effective Date, $240,000,000 and (b) at any time thereafter, an amount determined in accordance with Section 2.07(g).
“Agreement” means this Credit Agreement, including any schedules and exhibits hereto, as amended by the First Amendment, and as the same may from time to time be amended, modified, supplemented or restated.
“Applicable Margin” means, for any day, with respect to any ABR Loan or Eurodollar Loan, or with respect to the Commitment Fee Rate, as the case may be, the rate per annum set forth in the Borrowing Base Utilization Grid below based upon the Borrowing Base Utilization Percentage then in effect:
Borrowing Base Utilization Grid
  <25%
≥25%, but
<50%
≥50%, but
<75%
≥75%, but
<90%
≥90%
ABR Loans
1.00%
1.25%
1.50%
1.75%
2.00%
Eurodollar Loans
2.00%
2.25%
2.50%
2.75%
3.00%
Commitment Fee Rate
0.375%
0.375%
0.50%
0.50%
0.50%

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Consolidated Leverage Ratio for the Reference Period ending on the last day of any fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as applicable, exceeds 1.50 to 1.00, then the Applicable Margin set forth in the above grid with respect to ABR Loans and Eurodollar Loans (but, for purposes of clarity, not the Commitment Fee Rate) will, in each case, increase by 0.25% during the period from and including the first day immediately following the date the financial statements and the related compliance certificate are delivered pursuant to Section 8.01(a) or Section 8.01(b), as applicable, and Section 8.01(c) for such fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as applicable, through and including the date of delivery of the financial statements and the related compliance certificate pursuant to Section 8.01(a) or Section 8.01(b), as applicable, and Section 8.01(c) for the immediately succeeding fiscal quarter.

In the event that the certified calculation of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio previously delivered pursuant to Section 8.01(c) was inaccurate (and such inaccuracy is discovered while any Commitments or Loans are outstanding), and such inaccuracy, if corrected, would have led to the application of a higher Applicable Margin for the Loans for any period (an “Applicable Period”) than the Applicable Margin applied for such Applicable Period, then, to the extent any Commitments or Loans are outstanding at such time, (i) the Borrower shall as soon as practicable deliver to the Administrative Agent the correct certified calculation of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio for such Applicable Period, (ii) the Applicable Margin shall be determined as if the level for such higher Applicable Margin were applicable for such Applicable Period, and (iii) the Borrower shall within ten (10) Business Days of written demand thereof by the Administrative Agent pay to the Administrative Agent the accrued additional interest owing as a result of such increased Applicable Margin for the Loans for such Applicable Period, which payment shall be promptly applied by the Administrative Agent in accordance with this Agreement.

For the purposes of calculating EBITDAX for any Reference Period, (i) if during such Reference Period the Borrower or any Consolidated Restricted Subsidiary shall have made any Material Disposition, EBITDAX for such Reference Period shall be reduced by an amount equal to the EBITDAX (if positive) attributable to the Property that is the subject of such Material Disposition for such Reference Period or increased by an amount equal to the EBITDAX (if negative) attributable thereto for such Reference Period, (ii) if during such Reference Period the Borrower or any Consolidated Restricted Subsidiary shall have made a Material Acquisition, EBITDAX for such Reference Period shall be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such Material Acquisition occurred on the first day of such Reference Period and (iii) if during such Reference Period a Consolidated Subsidiary shall be redesignated as either a Consolidated Unrestricted Subsidiary or a Consolidated Restricted Subsidiary, EBITDAX shall be calculated after giving pro forma effect to such redesignation, as if such redesignation had occurred on the first day of such Reference
