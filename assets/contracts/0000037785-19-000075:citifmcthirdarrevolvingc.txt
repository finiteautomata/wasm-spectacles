  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION “Proposed Increased Commitment”), by notifying the Administrative Agent (which shall give prompt notice thereof to the U.S. Borrower) no later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date five days before the Increase Date. In no event shall any Lender be obligated to increase its Commitments hereunder.

If the Total Committed Increase is less than $25,000,000, then the Total Commitments shall not be changed. (vi) The Total Committed Increase shall be allocated among New Lenders having Proposed New Commitments and Lenders having Proposed Increased Commitments as follows: (A) If the Total Committed Increase shall be at least $25,000,000 and less than or equal to the Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase, then (x) the initial Commitment of each New Lender shall be such New Lender’s Proposed New Commitment and (y) the Commitment of each Lender shall be increased by such Lender’s Proposed Increased Commitment.

  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION (1) first to New Lenders (to the extent of their respective Proposed New Commitments) in such a manner as the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall agree; and (2) then to Lenders (to the extent of their respective Proposed Increased Commitments, if any) in such a manner as the U.S. Borrower shall determine in its sole discretion upon consultation with the Administrative Agent and the Syndication Agent. (vii) No increase in the Commitments contemplated hereby shall become effective until the Administrative Agent shall have received (x) Revolving Loan Notes payable by each of the Borrowers to each New Lender and each Increasing Lender, to the extent requested, and (y) evidence satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (including an update of paragraphs 2 and 4 of the opinion of counsel provided pursuant to Section 4.01(a)(v) that such increases in the Commitments, and Borrowings thereunder, have been duly authorized.

  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION Available Amount of all Letters of Credit (determined as aforesaid) does not exceed the Total Commitments; provided that any such payment shall be accompanied by any amounts payable under Section 9.04(c).

(iii) In addition, if on the last day of any Interest Period the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans (after giving effect to any Loans being made to repay Loans maturing on that date) (for which purpose the amount of any Loan that is denominated in an Alternate Currency shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent thereof) plus the Available Amount of all Letters of Credit (for which purpose the Available Amount of any Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternate Currency shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent thereof as of the date of determination) would exceed 100% of the then Total Commitments, the Administrative Agent shall use all reasonable efforts to give prompt written notice thereof to the U.S. Borrower, specifying the amount to be prepaid under this clause (iii), and the Borrowers shall, within two Business Days of the date of such notice, prepay the Loans, or cause Loans to be prepaid, or reduce the requested Loans in such amounts that after giving effect to such action the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans (after giving effect to any Loans being made to repay Loans maturing on that date) (determined as aforesaid) plus the Available Amount of all Letters of Credit (determined as aforesaid) does not exceed the Total Commitments; provided that any such payment shall be accompanied by any amounts payable under Section 9.04(c). (iv) The determinations of the Administrative Agent under this Section 2.07(e) shall be conclusive and binding on the U.S. Borrower and the other Borrowers in the absence of manifest error. (f) If any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender shall be deemed to have assigned any and all payments in respect of the Obligations due to it from or for the benefit of any Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.07 to the Non-Defaulting Lenders for application to, and reduction of, their ratable portion of all Obligations until such Non-Defaulting Lenders have been repaid in full. Such Defaulting Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to distribute such payments in accordance with Section 2.16(a)(iii).

Each Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Loan made by each Lender to such Borrower, from the date of such Loan until such principal amount shall be paid in full, at the following rates per annum and in each case subject to Section 2.16(a)(iii): (i) Base Rate Loans and Letter of Credit Loans. If such Loan is either a Revolving Loan or a Letter of Credit Loan which, in each case, bears interest at the Base Rate, a rate per annum equal at all times to the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus the Applicable Margin, payable on (A) each Quarterly Date while such Base Rate Loan is outstanding or (B) the last day of each month during which such Letter of Credit Loan is outstanding, and in each case, on the date such Base Rate Loan or Letter of Credit Loan shall be paid in full. (ii) Swing Loans. If such Loan is a Swing Loan (other than an Overdraft Advance, for which the rate shall be equal to the Overdraft Advance Interest Rate), a rate per annum equal at all times to the Swing Loan Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin (applicable to Eurocurrency Rate Loans) in effect from time to time, payable (A) on the first Business Day of each calendar quarter, commencing on the first such day following the making of such Swing Loan, (B) upon each payment or prepayment thereof in full or in part and (C) if not previously paid in full, at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) of such Swing Loan. (iii) Eurocurrency Rate Loans. If such Loan is a Eurocurrency Rate Loan, a rate per annum equal at all times during each Interest Period for such Loan to the sum of the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin, payable on the last day of such Interest Period and, if such Interest Period has a duration of more than three months, at three-month intervals following the first day of such Interest Period. (b) Default Interest. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default that has not been waived, the Administrative Agent may, and upon the request of the Required Lenders shall, require the Borrowers to pay to the fullest extent permitted by law interest (“Default Interest”) on all outstanding Obligations at the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans plus two percentage points (2%) per annum; provided however, that following the acceleration of the Loans and other Obligations pursuant to Section 7.01, Default Interest shall accrue and be payable hereunder whether or not previously required by the Administrative Agent.

(b) The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the U.S. Borrower and the Lenders of the applicable interest rate determined by the Administrative Agent for purposes of Section 2.08(a)(i), (ii) and (iii). (c) If prior to 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on any date on which an interest rate is to be determined pursuant to the definition of “Eurocurrency Rate”, (i) the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding on the U.S. Borrower) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency 38
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION Rate Loan, or (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Required Lenders in respect of the relevant facility that the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Eurocurrency Rate Loan for such Interest Period, then the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the U.S. Borrower and each Lender of such circumstances, whereupon the right of the Borrowers to select Eurocurrency Rate Loans for any requested Revolving Loan Borrowing or any subsequent Revolving Loan Borrowing shall be suspended until the first date on which the circumstances causing such suspension cease to exist. If the Borrowers shall not, in turn, before 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on such date notify the Administrative Agent that a Notice of Revolving Loan Borrowing with respect to such Eurocurrency Rate shall be converted to a Notice of Revolving Loan Borrowing for a Eurocurrency Rate Loan in a different Currency or a Base Rate Loan, such Notice of Revolving Loan Borrowing shall be deemed to be canceled and of no force or effect, and the U.S. Borrower shall not be liable to the Administrative Agent or any Lender with respect thereto except as set forth in Section 3.01(c). In the event of such a suspension, the Administrative Agent shall review the circumstances giving rise to such suspension at least weekly and shall notify the U.S. Borrower and the Lenders promptly of the end of such suspension, and thereafter the Borrowers shall be entitled, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, to borrow Eurocurrency Rate Loans and Swing Loans in such Currency. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent (with a copy to the U.S. Borrower) that the Required Lenders have determined, that: (i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Screen Rate or Interpolated Rate for any requested Interest Period, including because the Eurocurrency Rate is not available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or (ii) the supervisor for the administrator of the Eurocurrency Rate or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which LIBOR or the Eurocurrency Rate shall no longer be made available, or used for determining the interest rate of loans (such specific date, the “Scheduled Unavailability Date”), then, after such determination by the Administrative Agent or receipt by the Administrative Agent of such notice, as applicable, the Administrative Agent and the U.S. Borrower may amend this Agreement to replace the Eurocurrency Rate with an alternate benchmark rate (including any mathematical or other adjustments to the benchmark (if any) incorporated therein) that has been broadly accepted by the syndicated loan market in the United States in lieu of the then current Eurocurrency Rate (any such proposed rate, a “Eurocurrency Successor Rate”; provided that such Eurocurrency Successor Rate shall not be less than zero), together with any proposed Eurocurrency Successor Rate Conforming Changes and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 9.01, any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrowers unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent notice that such Required Lenders do not accept such amendment. 39
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION If no Eurocurrency Successor Rate has been determined and the circumstances under clause (i) above exist, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be suspended, (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Interest Periods). Upon receipt of such notice, any Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans (in the case of Borrowings in Dollars) in the amount specified therein (or Dollar Equivalent thereof, as applicable). (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Lender whose Termination Date falls prior to the last day of any Interest Period for any Eurocurrency Rate Loan (a “Relevant Lender”) shall participate in such Loan. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Relevant Lender shall (i) participate in a Borrowing of any Eurocurrency Rate Loan having an initial Interest Period ending after such Lender’s Termination Date, (ii) have any outstanding Eurocurrency Rate Loan continued for a subsequent Interest Period if such subsequent Interest Period would end after such Lender’s Termination Date or (iii) have any outstanding Base Rate Loan Converted into a Eurocurrency Rate Loan if such Eurocurrency Rate Loan would have an initial Interest Period ending after such Lender’s Termination Date. If any Relevant Lender has outstanding a Eurocurrency Rate Loan that cannot be continued for a subsequent Interest Period pursuant to clause (ii) above or has outstanding a Base Rate Loan that cannot be Converted into a Eurocurrency Rate Loan pursuant to clause (iii) above, such Lender’s ratable share of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan (in the case of said clause (ii)) shall be repaid by the relevant Borrower on the last day of its then current Interest Period and such Lender’s ratable share of such Base Rate Loan (in the case of said clause (iii)) shall be repaid by the relevant Borrower on the day on which the Loans of Lenders unaffected by said clause (iii) are so Converted. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Borrowers may fund the repayment of the Relevant Lenders’ ratable shares of such Eurocurrency Rate Loans and Base Rate Loans by borrowing from Lenders hereunder that are not Relevant Lenders. SECTION 2.10. Prepayments. (a) The Borrowers shall have no right to prepay any principal amount of any Revolving Loan or Swing Loan other than as provided in subsection (b) below. (b) Each Borrower may without premium or penalty, (i) upon at least the number of Business Days’ prior notice specified in the first sentence of Section 3.01(a) with respect to any Revolving Loan of the same Type, (ii) upon notice by no later than 11:00 AM (London time) one Business Day prior to the date of prepayment of any Swing Loan in any case given to the Administrative Agent stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment, and if such notice is given, such Borrower shall, prepay the outstanding principal amounts of the Loans made to such Borrower comprising part of the same Revolving Loan Borrowing or Swing Loan Borrowing, as the case may be, in whole or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid; provided however, that (x) each partial prepayment (other than any prepayment of any Swing Loan) shall be in an aggregate principal amount not less than $1,000,000 or an integral multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof (or the Foreign Currency Equivalent of such respective amounts in the case of Loans denominated in an Alternate Currency) and (y) if any prepayment of any Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be made on a date which is not the last day of an Interest Period for such Loans (or on a date which is not the maturity date of such Swing Loans), such Borrower shall also pay 40
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION any amounts owing to each Lender pursuant to Section 9.04(c) so long as such Lender makes written demand upon such Borrower therefor (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent) within 20 Business Days after such prepayment. SECTION 2.11. Payments and Computations. (a) All payments of principal of and interest on each Loan in a particular Currency shall be made in such Currency. (b) (i) All payments of principal of and interest on the Loans and all other amounts whatsoever payable by a Borrower under this Agreement and the Notes shall be made in immediately available funds, without deduction, setoff or counterclaim, to the Administrative Agent’s Account for the relevant Currency, not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) (in the case of amounts payable in Dollars) or 11:00 A.M. Local Time in the location of the Administrative Agent’s Account (in the case of amounts payable in an Alternate Currency), on the day when due. (ii) The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest or fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.09(d), 2.12, 2.15(c) or 3.05 or as contemplated by Section 2.05(c) or 2.16) to the Lenders entitled thereto for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (iii) Upon its acceptance of an Acceptance and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 9.07(d), from and after the effective date specified in such Acceptance the Administrative Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under the Notes in respect of the interest assigned or assumed thereby to the Lender assignee or New Lender thereunder (as the case may be). The parties to each Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves. (c) All computations of interest based on the Base Rate (other than if the Base Rate is computed on the basis of the Federal Funds Rate) and of facility fees and letter of credit commission shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based on the Eurocurrency Rate, the Swing Loan Rate or the Base Rate based on the Federal Funds Rate shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or fees are payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (d) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest, facility fee or, letter of credit commission, as the case may be; provided however, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurocurrency Rate 41
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION Loans to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day. (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each relevant Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent that such Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate. (f) Anything in Section 2.11(a) to the contrary notwithstanding, and without prejudice to Section 2.08(b) or 7.01(a), if any Borrower shall fail to pay any principal or interest denominated in an Alternate Currency within one Business Day after the due date therefor in the case of principal and three Business Days after the due date therefor in the case of interest (without giving effect to any acceleration of maturity under Article VII (Events of Default)), the amount so in default shall automatically be redenominated in Dollars on the day one Business Day after the due date therefor in the case of a principal payment and three Business Days after the due date therefor in the case of an interest payment in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such principal or interest. (g) If any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender shall be deemed to have assigned any and all payments in respect of the Obligations subject to this Section 2.11 due to it from and for the benefit of the Borrowers to the Non-Defaulting Lenders for application to, and reduction of, the Non-Defaulting Lenders’ ratable portion of all Obligations until such Non-Defaulting Lenders have been repaid in full. Each Defaulting Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to distribute such payments in accordance with Section 2.16(a)(iii). This Section 2.11(g) shall (i) apply at any time such Lender is a Defaulting Lender and be effective regardless of whether an Event of Default has occurred or is continuing and notwithstanding (1) any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary or (2) any instruction of the U.S. Borrower as to its desired application of payments and (ii) not be deemed to relieve or otherwise release any Borrower from any of its Obligations due or owing to any Lender, including a Defaulting Lender. SECTION 2.12. Taxes. (a) Defined Terms. For purposes of this Section, the term “Lender” includes any Issuing Bank and the term “Applicable Law” includes FATCA. (b) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrowers under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by Applicable Law. If any Applicable Law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in 42
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION accordance with Applicable Law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the Borrowers shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. (c) Payment of Other Taxes by Borrower. The Borrowers shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. (d) Indemnification by Borrower. The Borrowers shall indemnify each Recipient for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority, provided, however, that (i) no Borrower shall be liable to any Person, as the case may be, for any liability arising from or with respect to Indemnified Taxes, which results from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Recipient, (ii) so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such Recipient shall use its reasonable best efforts (all at the expense of such Borrower) to cooperate with each Borrower in contesting any Taxes or Other Taxes which such Borrower reasonably deems to be not correctly or legally asserted or otherwise not due and owing and (iii) no Borrower shall be liable to such Recipient for any such liability if such Person fails to make written demand for indemnification therefor within 120 days of receiving notice of the existence of such liability. This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Recipient makes written demand therefor. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Borrower or any Person. (e) Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrowers have not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrowers to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.07(f) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (e). (f) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by the Borrowers to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section, the Borrowers shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 43
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION (g) Status of Lenders. (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to any relevant Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the relevant Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable such Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in paragraphs (g)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) of this Section) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, with respect to the U.S. Borrower, (A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or about the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the U.S. Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or about the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the U.S. Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: (1) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty; (2) executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI; (3) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-1 to the 44
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the U.S. Borrower within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” related to the U.S. Borrower as described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E; or (4) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-2 or Exhibit F-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or about the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of such Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by Applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by Applicable Law to permit the U.S. Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and (D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the U.S. Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by Applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the U.S. Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. (iii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, with respect to any Borrower that is not a U.S. Person, any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is 45
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION legally entitled to do so, deliver to the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or about the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of such Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by Applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in applicable withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by Applicable Law to permit the applicable Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made. Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. For purposes of determining withholding taxes imposed under FATCA, the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall treat (and the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to treat) the Agreement as not qualifying as a “grandfathered obligation” within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1471-2(b)(2)(i)(A). (h) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (h) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (h), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (h) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. (i) Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. 46
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION (j) If a Borrower is required to pay any Lender any Taxes under Section 2.12(b) or (d), such Lender shall be an “Affected Person”, and the U.S. Borrower shall have the rights set forth in Section 3.08 to replace such Affected Person. (k) Survival. Each party’s obligations under this Section shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document. SECTION 2.13. Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Revolving Loans, the Swing Loans or the Letter of Credit Loans made by it (other than as expressly provided herein) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Revolving Loans, the Swing Loans or the Letter of Credit Loans obtained by all such Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from such other Lenders such participations in the Revolving Loans, the Swing Loans or the Letter of Credit Loans made by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them, provided however, that, if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and each Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.13 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation. SECTION 2.14. Conversion or Continuation of Revolving Loans. (a) Each Borrower may elect (i) at any time on any Business Day to Convert Base Rate Loans or any portion thereof to Eurocurrency Rate Loans or (ii) at the end of any applicable Interest Period, to Convert Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars or any portion thereof into Base Rate Loans or to Continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans or any portion thereof for an additional Interest Period; provided however, that the aggregate amount of the Eurocurrency Rate Loans Converted or Continued for each Interest Period must be in the amount of at least $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Each Conversion or Continuation shall be allocated among the Revolving Loans of each Lender in accordance with such Lender’s pro rata share. Subject to clause (b) below, each such election shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit B-2 (Form of Notice of Conversion or Continuation) (a “Notice of Conversion or Continuation”) and shall be made by giving the Administrative Agent (x) in the case of a Continuation or Conversion into Eurocurrency Rate Loans, at least three Business Days’ prior written notice, and (y) in the case of a Conversion into Base Rate Loans, at least one Business Day’s prior written notice, in each case, specifying (A) the amount and Type of Revolving Loan being Converted or Continued, (B) in the case of a Conversion to or a Continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, the applicable Interest Period and (C) in the case of a Conversion, the date of Conversion (which date shall be a Business Day and, if a Conversion from Eurocurrency Rate Loans, shall also be the last day of the applicable Interest Period). 47
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION (b) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of a Notice of Conversion or Continuation and of the options selected therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Conversion in whole or in part of Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Rate Loans, and no Continuation in whole or in part of Eurocurrency Rate Loans upon the expiration of any applicable Interest Period, shall be permitted at any time at which (A) a Default or an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or (B) the Continuation of, or Conversion into, a Eurocurrency Rate Loan would violate any provision of Section 2.09, 3.05 or 3.06. If, within the time period required under the terms of this Section 2.14, the Administrative Agent does not receive a Notice of Conversion or Continuation from the applicable Borrower containing a permitted election to Continue any Eurocurrency Rate Loans for an additional Interest Period or to Convert any such Revolving Loans, then, upon the expiration of the applicable Interest Period, such Revolving Loans, if denominated in Dollars, shall be automatically Converted to Base Rate Loans and such Revolving Loans, if denominated in Euros, shall be automatically Continued as Eurocurrency Rate Loans with an interest period of one month (or if consented to by all Lenders, seven days). Each Notice of Conversion or Continuation shall be irrevocable. (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall, upon the expiration of the applicable Interest Period, be automatically Converted to a Base Rate Loan. SECTION 2.15. Extension of Termination Date. (a) The U.S. Borrower may, by notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders) not less than 40 days and not more than 60 days prior to each of the first and second anniversaries of the Effective Date (each anniversary, an “Anniversary Date”), request that each Lender extend such Lender’s Termination Date to the date (the “New Termination Date”) that is one year after the then Final Termination Date; provided that the representations and warranties contained in Article V (Representations and Warranties) shall be correct in all material respects (except any representations and warranties that are qualified by materiality, which shall be true and correct in all respects) as of the date of such request, as though made on and as of such date, other than any such representations or warranties that, by their terms, refer to a different date, which shall be true and correct as of such earlier date. Each Lender, acting in its sole discretion, shall, by written notice to the Administrative Agent given no later than the date (the “Consent Date”) that is 20 days prior to the relevant Anniversary Date (provided that, if such date is not a Business Day, the Consent Date shall be the next succeeding Business Day), advise the Administrative Agent as to: (i) whether or not such Lender agrees to such extension of its Termination Date (each Lender so agreeing to such extension being an “Extending Lender”); and (ii) only if such Lender is an Extending Lender, whether or not such Lender also irrevocably offers to increase the amount of its Commitment (each Lender so offering to increase its Commitment being an “Increasing Lender” as well as an Extending Lender) and, if so, the amount of the additional Commitment such Lender so irrevocably offers to assume hereunder (such Lender’s “Proposed Additional Commitment”). 48
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION Each Lender that determines not to extend its Termination Date (a “Non-Extending Lender”) shall notify the Administrative Agent (which shall notify the Lenders) of such fact promptly after such determination but in any event no later than the Consent Date, and any Lender that does not advise the Administrative Agent in writing on or before the Consent Date shall be deemed to be a Non-Extending Lender and (without limiting the U.S. Borrower’s rights under Section 2.15(c)) shall have no liability to the U.S. Borrower in connection therewith. The election of any Lender to agree to such extension shall not obligate any other Lender to so agree. The Administrative Agent shall notify the U.S. Borrower of each Lender’s determination under this Section 2.15(a) no later than the date 15 days prior to the relevant Anniversary Date (or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the next preceding Business Day). (b) (i) If all of the Lenders are Extending Lenders, then, effective as of the Consent Date, the Termination Date of each Lender shall be extended to the New Termination Date, and the respective Commitments of the Lenders will not be subject to change at such Consent Date pursuant to this Section 2.15. (ii) If and only if the sum of (x) the aggregate amount of the Commitments of the Extending Lenders plus (y) the aggregate amount of the Proposed Additional Commitments of the Increasing Lenders (such sum, the “Extending Commitments”) shall be equal to at least 50% of the then Total Commitments, then: (A) effective as of the Consent Date, the Termination Date of each Extending Lender shall be extended to the New Termination Date; (B) the U.S. Borrower shall (so long as no Default shall have occurred and be continuing) have the right, but not the obligation, to take either of the following actions with respect to each Non-Extending Lender during the period commencing on the Consent Date and ending on the immediately succeeding Anniversary Date: (1) the U.S. Borrower may elect by notice to the Administrative Agent and such Non-Extending Lender that the Termination Date of such Non-Extending Lender be changed to a date (which date shall be specified in such notice) on or prior to such immediately succeeding Anniversary Date (and, upon the giving of such notice, the Termination Date of such Non-Extending Lender shall be so changed); or (2) the U.S. Borrower may replace such Non- Extending Lender as a party to this Agreement in accordance with Section 2.15(c); and (C) the Administrative Agent shall notify the Issuing Banks and the Swing Loan Lenders of the New Termination Date and the Lenders whose Termination Dates are the New Termination Date and each Issuing Bank and each Swing Loan Lender shall determine whether or not, acting in its sole discretion, it shall elect to extend its Termination Date to the New Termination Date and shall so notify the Administrative Agent. If such Issuing Bank or such Swing Loan Lender, as the case may be, has elected to so extend its Termination Date, then such Issuing Bank’s obligation to issue Letters of Credit pursuant to Sections 2.04 and 3.04 shall 49
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION be extended to the date that is 30 days prior to the New Termination Date and/or such Swing Loan Lender’s obligation to make Swing Loans to the Borrowers pursuant to Sections 2.03 and 3.03 shall be extended to the date that is 15 Business Days prior to the New Termination Date. (iii) If neither of the conditions specified in clause (i) or clause (ii) of this Section 2.15(b) is satisfied, then neither the Termination Date nor the Commitment of any Lender will change pursuant to this Section 2.15 on such Consent Date, and the U.S. Borrower will not have the right to take any of the actions specified in Section 2.06(b)(ii). (c) Replacement by the U.S. Borrower of Non-Extending Lenders pursuant to Section 2.15(b)(ii)(B)(2) shall be effected as follows (certain terms being used in this Section 2.15(c) having the meanings assigned to them in Section 2.15(d)) on the relevant Assignment Date: (i) the Assignors shall severally assign and transfer to the Assignees, and the Assignees shall severally purchase and assume from the Assignors, all of the Assignors’ rights and obligations (including, without limitation, the Assignors’ respective Commitments) hereunder and under the Notes; (ii) each Assignee shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for account of the Assignors, an amount equal to such Assignee’s Share of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans then held by the Assignors; (iii) the U.S. Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for account of the Assignors, all accrued interest, fees and other amounts (other than principal of outstanding Loans) then due and owing to the Assignors by the U.S. Borrower hereunder (including, without limitation, payments due such Assignors, if any, under Sections 2.12, 3.05 and 9.04(c)); and (iv) the U.S. Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for account of the Administrative Agent the $3,500 processing and recordation fee for each assignment effected pursuant to this Section 2.15(c). The assignments provided for in this Section 2.15(c) shall be effected on the relevant Assignment Date in accordance with Section 9.07 and pursuant to one or more Assignments and Acceptances. After giving effect to such assignments, each Assignee shall have a Commitment hereunder (which, if such Assignee was a Lender hereunder immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment, shall be in addition to such Assignee’s existing Commitment) in an amount equal to the amount of its Assumed Commitment representing a Commitment. Upon any such termination or assignment, such Assignor shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be obligated under Section 8.05 and be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.04, as well as to any fees and other amounts accrued for its account under Section 2.05, 2.12 or 3.05 and not yet paid. (d) For purposes of this Section 2.15, the following terms shall have the following meanings (such meanings to be equally applicable to both the singular and plural forms of the terms defined): 50
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION “Assigned Commitments” means the Commitments of Non-Extending Lenders to be replaced pursuant to Section 2.15(b)(ii)(B)(2). “Assignees” means, at any time, Increasing Lenders and, if the Assigned Commitments exceed the aggregate amount of the Proposed Additional Commitments, one or more New Lenders. “Assignment Date” means the Anniversary Date or such earlier date as shall be acceptable to the U.S. Borrower, the relevant Assignors, the relevant Assignees and the Administrative Agent. “Assignors” means, at any time, the Lenders to be replaced by the U.S. Borrower pursuant to Section 2.15(b)(ii)(B)(2). The “Assumed Commitment” of each Assignee shall be determined as follows: (a) If the aggregate amount of the Proposed Additional Commitments of all of the Increasing Lenders shall exceed the aggregate amount of the Assigned Commitments, then (i) the amount of the Assumed Commitment of each Increasing Lender shall be equal to (x) the aggregate amount of the Assigned Commitments multiplied by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to such Increasing Lender’s Commitment as then in effect and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of the Commitments of all Increasing Lenders as then in effect; and (ii) no New Lender shall become a Lender hereunder pursuant to Section 2.15(c). (b) If the aggregate amount of the Proposed Additional Commitments of all of the Increasing Lenders shall be less than or equal to the aggregate amount of the Assigned Commitments, then: (i) the amount of the Assumed Commitment of each Increasing Lender shall be equal to such Increasing Lender’s Proposed Additional Commitment; and (ii) the excess, if any, of the aggregate amount of the Assigned Commitments over the aggregate amount of the Proposed Additional Commitments shall be allocated among New Lenders in such a manner as the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent may agree. “Share” means, as to any Assignee, a fraction the numerator of which is equal to such Assignee’s Assumed Commitment and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of the Assumed Commitments of all the Assignees. SECTION 2.16. Defaulting Lender. (a) Reallocation of Defaulting Lender Commitments. If a Lender becomes, and during the period it remains, a Defaulting Lender, the following provisions shall apply: (i) in the case of each Defaulting Lender, the ratable portion of such Defaulting Lender with respect to any such outstanding Obligations will, subject to the limitation in the first proviso below, automatically be reallocated (effective on the date such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender) among the Lenders that are Non-Defaulting Lenders pro rata in accordance with such Non-Defaulting Lenders’ respective 51
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION Commitments; provided that (A) the sum of each Non-Defaulting Lender’s ratable portion of the Total Outstandings may not in any event exceed the Commitment of such Non-Defaulting Lender as in effect at the time of such reallocation and (B) neither such reallocation nor any payment by a Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant thereto will constitute a waiver or release of any claim any Borrower, the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank, any Swing Loan Lender or any other Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender, or cause such Defaulting Lender to be a Non-Defaulting Lender; (ii) in the case of each Defaulting Lender, to the extent that any portion (the “unreallocated portion”) of the ratable portion of such Defaulting Lender with respect to any such outstanding and future Letter of Credit Obligations and Swing Loans cannot be so reallocated, whether by reason of clause (A) of the proviso in clause (i) above or otherwise, the U.S. Borrower will, not later than 5 Business Days after demand by the Administrative Agent (at the direction of the Issuing Banks and/or the Swing Loan Lenders, as the case may be), (A) Cash Collateralize (pursuant to procedures similar to those detailed in Section 7.02 and reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent) the Obligations of the Borrowers to the Issuing Banks and the Swing Loan Lenders in respect of such Obligations or (B) make other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, and to the Issuing Banks and the Swing Loan Lenders, as the case may be, in their reasonable discretion, to protect them against the risk of non-payment by such Defaulting Lender; and (iii) in the case of each Defaulting Lender, any amount paid by the U.S. Borrower for the account of such Defaulting Lender under this Agreement (whether on account of principal, interest, fees, indemnity payments or other amounts) will not be paid or distributed to such Defaulting Lender, but will instead be retained by the Administrative Agent in a segregated, non-interest bearing account until (subject to Section 2.05(c)) the termination of the Commitments and payment in full of all the Obligations and will be applied by the Administrative Agent, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to the making of payments from time to time in the following order of priority: first to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, second to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to any Issuing Bank or any Swing Loan Lender (pro rata as to the respective amounts owing to each of them) under this Agreement, third to the payment of post-default interest and then current interest due and payable to the Lenders hereunder other than Defaulting Lenders as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement as determined in any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, any Issuing Bank or any Swing Loan Lender against such Defaulting Lender, ratably among them in accordance with the amounts of such interest then due and payable to them, fourth to the payment of fees then due and payable to the Non-Defaulting Lenders hereunder as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement as determined in any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, any Issuing Bank or any Swing Loan Lender against such Defaulting Lender, ratably among them in accordance with the amounts of such fees then due and payable to them, fifth to pay principal and Reimbursement Obligations in respect of the Letters of Credit at such time then due and payable to the Non-Defaulting Lenders hereunder ratably in accordance with the amounts thereof then due and payable to them, sixth to the ratable payment of other amounts then due and payable to the Non-Defaulting Lenders as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s 52
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION breach of its obligations under this Agreement as determined in any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, any Issuing Bank or any Swing Loan Lender against such Defaulting Lender, seventh after the termination of the Commitments and payment in full of all the Obligations, to pay amounts owing under this Agreement to such Defaulting Lender or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct. (b) Cash Collateral Call. If any Lender becomes, and during the period it remains, a Defaulting Lender, if any Letter of Credit is at the time outstanding, the Issuing Banks may (except, in the case of a Defaulting Lender, to the extent the Commitments have been fully reallocated pursuant to Section 2.16(a)), by notice to the Borrowers and such Defaulting Lender through the Administrative Agent, require any Borrower (i) to deposit in a cash collateral account maintained by the Administrative Agent an amount at least equal to 105% of the aggregate amount of the unreallocated obligations (contingent or otherwise) of such Defaulting Lender to be applied pro rata in respect thereof, or (ii) to make other arrangements satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, and to the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, in their sole discretion to protect them against the risk of non-payment by such Defaulting Lender. (c) Right to Give Drawdown Notices. In furtherance of the foregoing, if any Lender becomes, and during the period it remains, a Defaulting Lender, and the applicable Borrower fails to Cash Collateralize (pursuant to procedures similar to those detailed in Section 7.02 and reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent) or prepay its obligations in respect of Letter of Credit Obligations or Swing Loans within 5 Business Days after demand by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.16, any Issuing Bank or Swing Loan Lender is hereby authorized by the Borrowers (which authorization is irrevocable and coupled with an interest) to give, in its discretion, through the Administrative Agent, Notices of Borrowing pursuant to Section 3.01 in such amounts and in such times as may be required to (i) pay matured Reimbursement Obligations, (ii) repay an outstanding Swing Loan, and/or (iii) Cash Collateralize (pursuant to procedures similar to those detailed in Section 7.02 and reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent) the Obligations of the applicable Borrower in respect of Letters of Credit Obligations or Swing Loans in an amount at least equal to the aggregate amount of the obligations (contingent or otherwise) of such Defaulting Lender in respect of such Letter of Credit or Swing Loan. (d) Termination of Defaulting Lender Commitments. The U.S. Borrower may terminate the unused amount of the Commitment of a Defaulting Lender upon not less than 10 Business Days’ prior notice to the Administrative Agent (who will promptly notify the Lenders thereof), and in such event the provisions of Section 2.11 will apply to all amounts thereafter paid by the U.S. Borrower for the account of such Defaulting Lender under this Agreement (whether on account of principal, interest, fees, indemnity or other amounts); provided that such termination will not be deemed to be a waiver or release of any claim any Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks, the Swing Loan Lenders or any Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender. (e) Cure. If the U.S. Borrower, Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Swing Loan Lenders, as applicable, agree in writing in their discretion that a Lender that is a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, as the case may be, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any amounts then held in the segregated account referred to in Section 2.16(a)), such Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase such portion of outstanding 53
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION Loans of the other Lenders and/or make such other adjustments as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause such Lender’s ratable portion to be on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective Commitment, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender and will become a Non-Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrowers while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Non-Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lender having been a Defaulting Lender. (f) Non-Defaulting Lender. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the occurrence of any Lender becoming a Defaulting Lender shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations to make such Loan or payment on any date required under this Agreement and no other Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any Defaulting Lender to make any Loan or payment required under this Agreement. SECTION 2.17. Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of EEA Financial Institutions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any EEA Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the write-down and conversion powers of an EEA Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by: (a) the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by an EEA Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an EEA Financial Institution; and (b) the effects of any Bail-in Action on any such liability, including, if applicable: (i) a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability; (ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such EEA Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or (iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of any EEA Resolution Authority. ARTICLE III MAKING THE LOANS AND ISSUING THE LETTERS OF CREDIT SECTION 3.01. Making the Revolving Loans. (a) Each Revolving Loan Borrowing shall be made on notice, given not later than (x) 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan Borrowing, and (y) 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the day of a 54
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION Base Rate Loan Borrowing, by the U.S. Borrower (on its own behalf and on behalf of any Euro Borrower) to the Administrative Agent, which shall give to each Lender prompt notice thereof. Each notice of a Revolving Loan Borrowing (a “Notice of Revolving Loan Borrowing”) shall be made in writing by telecopier, electronic mail, telex or cable, in substantially the form of Exhibit B-1 hereto, specifying therein the requested (i) date of such Revolving Loan Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), (ii) Currency and Type of Revolving Loan comprising such Revolving Loan Borrowing, (iii) aggregate amount of such Revolving Loan Borrowing, (iv) in the case of a Revolving Loan Borrowing comprised of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, the Interest Period for each such Revolving Loan, and (v) the name of the Borrower (which shall be the U.S. Borrower or a Euro Borrower). Each Lender shall (A) before 11:00 A.M. Local Time on the date of such Borrowing (in the case of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan Borrowing) and (B) before 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date of such Borrowing (in the case of a Base Rate Loan Borrowing), make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent’s Account for the relevant Currency in same day funds, such Lender’s ratable portion of such Borrowing. After the Administrative Agent’s receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article IV (Conditions of Lending), the Administrative Agent will make such funds available to the relevant Borrower in such manner as the Administrative Agent and the U.S. Borrower may agree; provided however, that the Administrative Agent shall first make a portion of such funds equal to the aggregate principal amount of any Swing Loan and Letter of Credit Loans as to which a Borrower has received timely notice made by the Swing Loan Lenders or the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, or by any other Lender and outstanding on the date of such Revolving Loan Borrowing, plus interest accrued and unpaid thereon to and as of such date, available to the relevant Swing Loan Lenders or the relevant Issuing Banks, as the case may be, and such other Lenders for repayment of such Swing Loans and Letter of Credit Loans. (b) Anything in subsection (a) above to the contrary notwithstanding, the U.S. Borrower may not select Eurocurrency Rate Loans for any Revolving Loan Borrowing if the aggregate amount of such Revolving Loan Borrowing is less than $1,000,000 or the Foreign Currency Equivalent thereof. (c) Subject to Sections 2.09(c) and 3.06, each Notice of Revolving Loan Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the U.S. Borrower and the relevant Borrower. In the case of any Revolving Loan Borrowing by a Borrower which the related Notice of Revolving Loan Borrowing specifies is to be comprised of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, such Borrower shall indemnify each relevant Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the date specified in such Notice of Revolving Loan Borrowing for such Revolving Loan Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article IV (Conditions of Lending), including, without limitation, any loss (excluding loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the Revolving Loan to be made by such Lender as part of such Revolving Loan Borrowing when such Revolving Loan, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date. (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the time any Revolving Loan Borrowing is required to be made that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s ratable portion of such Revolving Loan Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Revolving Loan 55
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 3.01 and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the relevant Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the relevant Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to such Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to Revolving Loans comprising such Revolving Loan Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate, provided that such Borrower retains its rights against such Lender with respect to any damages it may incur as a result of such Lender’s failure to fund, and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall such Borrower be liable to such Lender or any other Person for the interest payable by such Lender to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this sentence. If such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lender’s Revolving Loan as part of such Revolving Loan Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement. (e) The failure of any Lender to make the Revolving Loan to be made by it as part of any Revolving Loan Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Revolving Loan on the date of such Revolving Loan Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Revolving Loan to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Revolving Loan Borrowing. SECTION 3.02. [Intentionally Deleted]. SECTION 3.03. Making the Swing Loans, Etc. (a) In order to request a Swing Loan, a Swing Loan Borrower shall telecopy (or forward by electronic mail or similar means) to the applicable Swing Loan Lender, with a copy to the Administrative Agent, a duly completed request in substantially the form of Exhibit E (Form of Swing Loan Request), setting forth the requested amount, currency and date of such Swing Loan (a “Swing Loan Request”), to be received by the Swing Loan Lender not later than 12:00 p.m. (London time) on the day of the proposed borrowing. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Swing Loan Lender agrees to make, on the date of the relevant Swing Loan Request, the Swing Loan specified in such Swing Loan Request available to the Swing Loan Borrower. The Swing Loan Lender shall not be required to determine that, or take notice whether, the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.02 have been satisfied in connection with the making of any Swing Loan. (b) Any Swing Loan Lender may demand at any time that each Lender pay in Dollars to the Administrative Agent, for the account of such Swing Loan Lender, in the manner provided in clause (c) below, such Lender’s pro rata share of all or a portion of the Dollar Equivalent of its outstanding Swing Loans, which demand shall be made through the Administrative Agent, shall be in writing and shall specify the outstanding principal amount of the Swing Loans demanded to be paid and the Dollar Equivalent (as determined by such Swing Loan Lender) of such outstanding principal amount if such Swing Loans are denominated in an Alternate Currency; provided however, the Swing Loan Lenders shall not make any Swing Loan in the period commencing on the first Business Day after it receives written notice from any Lender that one or more of the conditions precedent contained in Section 4.02 shall not on such date be satisfied or duly waived and ending when such conditions are satisfied or duly waived. 56
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION (c) The Administrative Agent shall forward each demand referred to in clause (b) above to each Lender on the day such demand is received by the Administrative Agent (except that any such demand received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. (New York time) on any Business Day or on a day that is not a Business Day shall not be required to be forwarded to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent until the next succeeding Business Day), together with a statement prepared by the Administrative Agent specifying the amount in Dollars of each Lender’s pro rata share of the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of the Swing Loans demanded to be paid pursuant to such demand, and, notwithstanding whether or not the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.02 shall have been satisfied (which conditions precedent the Lenders hereby irrevocably waive), each Lender shall, before 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the Business Day next succeeding the date of such Lender’s receipt of such demand, make available to the Administrative Agent, in immediately available funds in Dollars, for the account of the applicable Swing Loan Lender, the amount specified in such statement. Upon such payment by a Lender, such Lender shall, except as provided in clause (d) below, be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan in Dollars in an amount equal to such payment to the relevant Swing Loan Borrower (and the U.S. Borrower and the Swing Loan Borrowers hereby authorizes the making of such Loan). The Administrative Agent shall use such funds to repay the Swing Loans to such Swing Loan Lender. To the extent that any Lender fails to make such payment available to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Swing Loan Lender, the Swing Loan Borrowers shall repay such Swing Loan or Swing Loans, as the case may be, on demand. (d) If for any reason the Swing Loans cannot be refinanced by such Loans in accordance with clause (c) above, each Lender shall acquire, without recourse or warranty, an undivided participation in each Swing Loan otherwise required to be repaid by such Lender pursuant to clause (c) above, which participation shall be in a principal amount equal to such Lender’s pro rata share of the Dollar Equivalent of such Swing Loan, by paying in Dollars to the applicable Swing Loan Lender on the date on which such Lender would otherwise have been required to make a payment in respect of such Swing Loan pursuant to clause (c) above, in immediately available funds, an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Lender’s pro rata share of such Swing Loan (and, concurrently with such acquisition, such Swing Loan shall be automatically converted to Dollars equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Swing Loan bearing interest at the Base Rate). If all or part of such amount is not in fact made available by such Lender to such Swing Loan Lender on such date, such Swing Loan Lender shall be entitled to recover any such unpaid amount on demand from such Lender together with interest accrued from such date at the Federal Funds Rate for the first Business Day after such payment was due and thereafter at the rate of interest then applicable to Base Rate Loans. (e) From and after the date on which any Lender (i) is deemed to have made a Loan pursuant to clause (c) above with respect to any Swing Loan or (ii) purchases an undivided participation interest in a Swing Loan pursuant to clause (d) above, the Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute to such Lender such Lender’s pro rata share of all payments of principal of and interest received by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the applicable Swing Loan Lender on account of such Swing Loan (all of which such payments shall be made in Dollars, regardless of the currency in which such Swing Loan was originally made) other than those received from a Lender pursuant to clause (c) or (d) above and subject to Section 2.16 with regard to any Defaulting Lender. If any payment received and so distributed by any Swing Loan Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swing Loan is required to be returned by the Swing Loan Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 9.05 (including pursuant 57
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION to any settlement entered into by the Swing Loan Lender in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to such Swing Loan Lender its pro rata share thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. The Administrative Agent shall make such demand upon the request of such Swing Loan Lender. The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. (f) The parties hereto acknowledge that the Swing Loan Lenders may from time to time make loans to any Swing Loan Borrower pursuant to an overdraft, autoborrow or similar arrangement (the “Overdraft Facility”). The loans made pursuant to the Overdraft Facility (the “Overdraft Advances”) shall be deemed Swing Loans for all purposes hereof and shall be subject to all of the provisions hereof; provided that (1) provisions relating to the fact that the Overdraft Facility is an uncommitted facility shall prevail; (2) the borrowing procedures set forth in the Overdraft Documents shall prevail in the event of any conflict between such borrowing procedures and clause (a) above; (3) the optional prepayment provisions set forth in the Overdraft Documents shall prevail in the event of any conflict between such provisions and Section 2.07; (4) any mandatory prepayment provisions set forth in the Overdraft Documents shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of or replacement of, the mandatory prepayment provisions set forth in Section 2.07; and (5) interest on each Overdraft Advance shall be due and payable in arrears on each date set forth in the Overdraft Documents in the event of any conflict between such interest payment dates and the interest payment dates set forth herein. (g) Each Lender’s obligation to make Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Loans pursuant to this Section 3.03 shall be absolute and unconditional, and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against any Swing Loan Lender, any Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (iii) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing. No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of any Swing Loan Borrower to repay any Swing Loans made to it, together with interest as provided herein. (h) Any Swing Loan Lender may resign at any time upon not less than 90 days’ prior written notice to the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent, during which period such Swing Loan Lender shall cooperate with the U.S. Borrower in putting in place a new Swing Loan Lender designated by the U.S. Borrower and acceptable to the Administrative Agent; provided that such resigning Swing Loan Lender shall retain all the rights and obligations of a Swing Loan Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swing Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require the Lenders to make Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swing Loans pursuant to this Section 3.03. If there are no other Swing Loan Lenders, and no such Swing Loan Lender is appointed, in each case prior to the effectiveness of such resignation, no Swing Loan Borrower shall be entitled to request Swing Loans until such a Swing Loan Lender is appointed. SECTION 3.04. Issuance of Letters of Credit. (a) No Issuing Bank shall be under any obligation to Issue any Letter of Credit upon the occurrence of any of the following: 58
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION (i) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall purport by its terms to enjoin or restrain such Issuing Bank from Issuing such Letter of Credit or any Requirement of Law applicable to such Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such Issuing Bank shall prohibit, or request that such Issuing Bank refrain from, the Issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon such Issuing Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction or reserve or capital requirement (for which such Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated) not in effect on the date of this Agreement or that would result in any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense that was not applicable, in effect or known to such Issuing Bank as of the date of this Agreement and that such Issuing Bank in good faith deems material to it; (ii) such Issuing Bank shall have received any written notice of the type described in clause (c) below; (iii) after giving effect to the Issuance of such Letter of Credit, (A) the aggregate Total Outstandings would exceed the aggregate of the Commitments in effect at such time or (B) the Letter of Credit Obligations at such time would exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit; (iv) any fees due in connection with any Issuance have not been paid; (v) such Letter of Credit is requested to be Issued in a form that is not acceptable to such Issuing Bank; or (vi) such Letter of Credit is requested to be denominated in any currency other than Dollars or (if requested by a Euro Borrower) Euros. None of the Lenders (other than the Issuing Banks in their capacity as such) shall have any obligation to Issue any Letter of Credit. (b) In connection with the Issuance of each Letter of Credit, the U.S. Borrower or a Euro Borrower, as applicable and appropriate, shall give the relevant Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent at least two Business Days’ prior written notice, in form and substance acceptable to the applicable Issuing Bank, of the requested Issuance of such Letter of Credit (a “Letter of Credit Request”). Such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the Issuing Bank of such Letter of Credit, the Currency of Issuance (Dollars or Euros) and face amount of the Letter of Credit requested, the date of Issuance of such requested Letter of Credit, the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which date shall be a Business Day) and the Person for whose benefit the requested Letter of Credit is to be issued. Such notice, to be effective, must be received by the relevant Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the second Business Day prior to the date of the requested Issuance of such Letter of Credit. (c) Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this Section 3.04 and in Section 2.04, the relevant Issuing Bank shall, on the requested date, Issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the applicable Borrower in accordance with such Issuing Bank’s usual and customary business practices. No Issuing Bank shall Issue any Letter of Credit in the period commencing on the first Business Day after it receives written notice from any Lender that one or 59
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION more of the conditions precedent contained in Section 4.02 shall not on such date be satisfied or duly waived and ending when such conditions are satisfied or duly waived. The relevant Issuing Bank shall not otherwise be required to determine that, or take notice whether, the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.02 have been satisfied in connection with the Issuance of any Letter of Credit. (d) If requested by the relevant Issuing Bank, prior to the issuance of each Letter of Credit by such Issuing Bank, and as a condition of such Issuance and of the participation of each Lender in the Letter of Credit Obligations arising with respect thereto in accordance with clause (f) below, the applicable Borrower shall have delivered to such Issuing Bank a letter of credit reimbursement agreement, in such form as the Issuing Bank may employ in its ordinary course of business for its own account (a “Letter of Credit Reimbursement Agreement”), signed by such Borrower, and such other documents or items as may be required pursuant to the terms thereof. In the event of any conflict between the terms of any Letter of Credit Reimbursement Agreement and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall govern. (e) Each Issuing Bank shall: (i) give the Administrative Agent written notice (which writing may be a telecopy or electronic mail) of the Issuance of a Letter of Credit Issued by it, of all drawings under a Letter of Credit Issued by it and the payment (or the failure to pay when due) by the applicable Borrower of any Reimbursement Obligation when due, other than drawings under Letters of Credit issued to support the IRB Obligations and reimbursement payments in respect thereof that are made when due (which notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit by telecopy, electronic mail or similar transmission to each Lender); (ii) upon the request of any Lender, furnish to such Lender, copies of any Letter of Credit Reimbursement Agreement to which such Issuing Bank is a party and such other documentation as may reasonably be requested by such Lender; and (iii) no later than 10 Business Days following the last day of each calendar month, provide to the Administrative Agent (and the Administrative Agent shall provide a copy to each Lender requesting the same) and the U.S. Borrower separate schedules for Documentary Letters of Credit and Standby Letters of Credit issued by it under the Letter of Credit Sub-Facility, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, setting forth the aggregate Letter of Credit Obligations outstanding at the end of each month and any information requested by the U.S. Borrower or the Administrative Agent relating thereto. (f) Immediately upon the issuance by an Issuing Bank of a Letter of Credit in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to each Lender, and each Lender shall be deemed irrevocably and unconditionally to have purchased and received from such Issuing Bank, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation, to the extent of such Lender’s pro rata share of the Commitments, in such Letter of Credit and the obligations of the applicable Borrower with respect thereto (including all Letter of Credit Obligations with respect thereto) and any security therefor and guaranty pertaining thereto. 60
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION (g) Each Borrower agrees to pay to the Issuing Bank of any Letter of Credit the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of all Reimbursement Obligations owing to such Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit issued for its account no later than the date that is the next succeeding Business Day after such Borrower receives written notice from such Issuing Bank that payment has been made under such Letter of Credit (the “Reimbursement Date”), irrespective of any claim, set-off, defense or other right that such Borrower may have at any time against such Issuing Bank or any other Person. (h) In the event that any Issuing Bank makes any payment under any Letter of Credit and the applicable Borrower shall not have repaid the Dollar Equivalent of such amount to such Issuing Bank pursuant to clause (g) or any such payment by such Borrower is rescinded or set aside for any reason, such Reimbursement Obligation shall be payable on demand with interest thereon computed (i) from the date on which such Reimbursement Obligation arose to the Reimbursement Date, at the rate of interest applicable during such period to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans and (ii) from the Reimbursement Date until the date of repayment in full, at the rate of interest applicable during such period to past due Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans, and such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, which shall promptly notify each Lender of such failure, and each Lender shall promptly and unconditionally pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank the amount of such Lender’s pro rata share of such payment in Dollars (based upon the Dollar Equivalent of such amount on the date of such payment) and in immediately available funds. If the Administrative Agent so notifies such Lender prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on any Business Day, such Lender shall make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank its pro rata share of the amount of such payment on such Business Day in immediately available funds. Upon such payment by a Lender, such Lender shall, except during the continuance of a Default or Event of Default under Section 7.01(e) and notwithstanding whether or not the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.02 shall have been satisfied (which conditions precedent the Lenders hereby irrevocably waive), be deemed to have made a Revolving Loan to applicable Borrower in the principal amount of such payment. Whenever any Issuing Bank receives from the U.S. Borrower a payment of a Reimbursement Obligation as to which the Administrative Agent has received for the account of such Issuing Bank any payment from a Lender pursuant to this clause (h), such Issuing Bank shall pay to the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to each Lender, in immediately available funds, an amount equal to such Lender’s pro rata share of the amount of such payment adjusted, if necessary, to reflect the respective amounts the Lenders have paid in respect of such Reimbursement Obligation.

(c) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.05 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation, provided that no Borrower shall be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the U.S. Borrower of the circumstances giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the circumstances giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).

(e) If the U.S. Borrower is required to pay any Lender any amounts under this Section 3.05, the applicable Lender shall be an “Affected Person”, and the U.S. Borrower shall have the rights set forth in Section 3.08 to replace such Affected Person. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, for purposes of this Section 3.05, each of (i) the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and all requests, rules, guidelines and directives promulgated thereunder and (ii) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives concerning capital adequacy or liquidity effective after the date hereof promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities are deemed to have been introduced or adopted after the date hereof, regardless of the date enacted or adopted. 64
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION SECTION 3.06. Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Lender or any Swing Loan Lender, as the case may be, shall notify the Administrative Agent that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such Lender or such Swing Loan Lender, as the case may be, or its Eurocurrency Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Swing Loans, as the case may be, or to fund or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Swing Loans hereunder, as the case may be, then, subject to the provisions of Section 3.08, (i) the obligation of such Lender to make Eurocurrency Rate Loans hereunder or the obligations of such Swing Loan Lender to make Swing Loans hereunder (including, without limitation, to any Borrower who is also a Foreign Subsidiary), as the case may be, shall be suspended until the first date on which the circumstances causing such suspension cease to exist (and, to the extent required by applicable Law, cancelled), (ii) any Eurocurrency Rate Loans made or to be made by such Lender shall be converted automatically to Base Rate Loans and any Swing Loans made or to be made by such Swing Loan Lender shall be converted to Swing Loans denominated in Dollars and (iii) such Lender or such Swing Loan Lender, as the case may be, shall be an “Affected Person”, and the U.S. Borrower shall have the right set forth in Section 3.08 to replace such Affected Person.

Each Lender and each Swing Loan Lender shall use its reasonable best efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to minimize any amounts payable by the Borrowers under Section 3.05 and to minimize any period of illegality described in Section 3.06. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Lender and each Swing Loan Lender agrees that, to the extent reasonably possible to such Lender or such Swing Loan Lender, as the case may be, it will change its Eurocurrency Lending Office if such change would eliminate or reduce amounts payable to it under Section 3.05 or eliminate any illegality of the type described in Section 3.06, as the case may be. Each Lender and each Swing Loan Lender further agrees to notify the U.S. Borrower promptly, but in any event within five Business Days, after such Lender or such Swing Loan Lender, as the case may be, learns of the circumstances giving rise to such a right to payment or such illegality have changed such that such right to payment or such illegality, as the case may be, no longer exists.

In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof.

Such new Revolving Loan Note shall be dated the relevant Increase Date and shall otherwise be in substantially the form of Exhibit A-l hereto. (f) Each Lender may, without the consent of, or notice to, any Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Person, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (other than (x) any natural person (or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural person), (y) any Borrower or any Affiliates of such Borrower or (z) any Defaulting Lender) in or to a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, a portion of its Commitments, the Loans owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it); provided however, that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, its Commitments hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes of this Agreement, (iv) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, (v) except in the case of a participation involving a Lender and one of its Affiliates (and this exception shall apply only so long as the participant remains an Affiliate of such Lender), the parties to each such participation shall execute a participation agreement in substantially the form of the Participation Agreement, and (vi) no participant under any such participation shall have any right to approve any amendment to or waiver of any provision of any Loan Document, or any consent to any departure by any Borrower therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment, waiver or consent would alter the principal of, or interest on, the Loan or Loans in which such participant is participating or any fees or other amounts payable to the Lenders hereunder, or postpone any date 97
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Loans or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder. Each Lender shall provide the U.S. Borrower with a list of entities party to all Participation Agreements with such Lender upon request. Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph to the contrary, any bank that is a member of the Farm Credit System that (a) has purchased a participation of at least $10,000,000 on or after the Effective Date, (b) is, by written notice to the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent (“Voting Participant Notification”), designated by the selling Lender as being entitled to be accorded the rights of a Voting Participant hereunder (any bank that is a member of the Farm Credit System so designated being called a “Voting Participant”) and (c) receives the prior written consent of the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent to become a Voting Participant, shall be entitled to vote (and the voting rights of the selling Lender shall be correspondingly reduced), on a dollar-for-dollar basis, as if such participant were a Lender, on any matter requiring or allowing a Lender to provide or withhold its consent, or to otherwise vote on any proposed action. To be effective, each Voting Participant Notification shall, with respect to any Voting Participant, (i) state the full name, as well as all contact information required of an assignee as set forth in Exhibit C-1 hereto and (ii) state the dollar amount of the participation purchased. The U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on information contained in notices delivered pursuant to this paragraph.

To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.05 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the U.S. Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each participant and the principal and interest amounts of each participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations hereunder (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any participant or any information relating to a participant’s interest in any Loan or other obligation hereunder) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103−1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. (g) Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 9.07, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant, any information, including Confidential Information, relating to the Borrowers furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrowers; provided that, prior to any such disclosure of Confidential Information, the assignee or participant 98
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION or proposed assignee or participant shall be informed of the confidential nature of such Confidential Information and shall agree to (i) preserve the confidentiality of any Confidential Information relating to the Borrowers received by it from such Lender and (ii) be bound by the provisions of Section 9.11. (h) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, an Eligible Assignee shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.12 or 3.05 than the assigning Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a change in law that occurs after the effective date of such assignment. (i) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement, any Lender may at any time and without the consent of the Administrative Agent or any Borrower create a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Loans owing to it and the Notes held by it), including in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or any other central banking authority. SECTION 9.08. No Liability of the Issuing Banks. Each Borrower assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee of any Letter of Credit with respect to its use of such Letter of Credit.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Issuing Bank acting in good faith may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary. SECTION 9.09. Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT, AND ALL CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE) THAT MAY BE BASED UPON, ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE IN ANY WAY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY PRINCIPLE OF CONFLICTS OF LAW THAT COULD REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF ANY OTHER LAW. SECTION 9.10. Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which 99
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

For purposes of this Section 9.11, “Confidential Information” means all information received from the U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective certified public accountants (including the Borrowers’ Accountants) relating to the U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, provided that, in the case of information received from the U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Confidential Information as provided in this Section 9.11 shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. SECTION 9.12. Submission to Jurisdiction; Service of Process. (a) Any legal action or proceeding brought by any Borrower or any of its respective Affiliates with respect to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be brought exclusively in the courts of the State of New York located in the City of New York, borough of Manhattan, or of the United States of America for the Southern District of New York.

Each Borrower agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

The payment obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement and the Notes shall not be discharged by an amount paid in another currency or in another place, whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise, to the extent that the amount so paid on conversion to the Specified Currency and transfer to the Specified Place under normal banking procedures does not yield the amount of the Specified Currency at the Specified Place due hereunder. If for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in the Specified Currency into another currency (the “Second Currency”), the rate of exchange which shall be applied shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the Specified Currency with the Second Currency on the Business Day next preceding that on which such judgment is rendered. The obligation of each Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (an “Entitled Person”) shall, notwithstanding the rate of exchange actually applied in rendering such judgment, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Entitled Person of any sum adjudged to be due hereunder or under the Notes in the Second Currency such Entitled Person may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase and transfer to the Specified Place the Specified Currency with the amount of the Second Currency so adjudged to be due; and each Borrower hereby, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, agrees to indemnify such Entitled Person against, and to pay such Entitled Person on demand in the Specified Currency, any difference between the sum originally due to such Entitled 101
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION Person in the Specified Currency and the amount of the Specified Currency so purchased and transferred. SECTION 9.15. European Monetary Union. (a) Payments by the Administrative Agent Generally. With respect to the payment of any amount denominated in Euro, the Administrative Agent shall not be liable to any of the Borrowers, the Swing Loan Lenders or any of the Lenders in any way whatsoever for any delay, or the consequences of any delay, in the crediting to any account of any amount required by this Agreement to be paid by the Administrative Agent if the Administrative Agent shall have taken all relevant steps to achieve, on the date required by this Agreement, the payment of such amount in immediately available, freely transferable, cleared funds (in Euro) to the account of any Borrower, any Swing Loan Lender or any Lender in the Principal Financial Center in the Participating Member State which such Borrower, such Swing Loan Lender or such Lender, as the case may be, shall have specified for such purpose. For the purposes of this paragraph, “all relevant steps” means all such steps as may be prescribed from time to time by the regulations or operating procedures of such clearing or settlement system as the Administrative Agent may from time to time determine for the purpose of clearing or settling payments in Euro. (b) Other Consequential Changes. Without prejudice to the respective liabilities of the Borrowers to the Lenders and the Swing Loan Lenders, and the Lenders and the Swing Loan Lenders to the Borrowers, under or pursuant to this Agreement, except as expressly provided in this Section 9.15, each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to time reasonably specify to be necessary or appropriate to reflect the introduction of or changeover to Euros in Participating Member States. SECTION 9.16. USA PATRIOT Act. Each Lender subject to the Patriot Act hereby notifies each Borrower that, pursuant to Section 326 of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the “Patriot Act”) and the Beneficial Ownership Regulation, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, including the name and address of such Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to identify each Borrower in accordance with the Patriot Act and the Beneficial Ownership Regulation. SECTION 9.17. Continued Effectiveness. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this Agreement is not intended to and shall not serve to affect a novation of the obligations under the Existing Credit Agreement, as continued hereunder. Instead, it is the express intention of the parties hereto to reaffirm the indebtedness created under the Existing Credit Agreement. The Existing Credit Agreement and all agreements, instruments and documents executed or delivered in connection with the Existing Credit Agreement shall each be deemed to be amended as of the Effective Date to the extent necessary to give effect to the provisions of this Agreement. SECTION 9.18. Entire Agreement.

(b) In addition, unless either (1) sub-clause (i) in the immediately preceding clause (a) is true with respect to a Lender or (2) a Lender has provided another representation, warranty and covenant in accordance with sub-clause (iv) in the immediately preceding clause (a), such Lender further (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Agents, and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of any Borrower, or any other Subsidiary of the Borrowers, that the Agents are not a fiduciary with respect to the assets of such Lender involved in such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement (including in connection with the reservation or exercise of any rights by any Agent under this Agreement, any Loan Document or any documents related hereto or thereto). ARTICLE X GUARANTY SECTION 10.01. Guaranty.

This guaranty constitutes a guaranty of payment and not of collection. (b) The U.S. Borrower further agrees that, (i) if any payment made by any of the Euro Borrowers or any other person and applied to the Guarantied Obligations is at any time annulled, avoided, set aside, rescinded, invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential or otherwise required to be refunded or repaid, or (ii) if any payment is made by any Lender or any other holder of Guarantied Obligations (the “Guarantied Parties”) to any Euro Borrower, its estate, trustee, receiver or any other party, including the U.S. Borrower, under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then, in each case, to the extent of such payment or repayment, the U.S. Borrower’s liability under this Section 10.01 shall be and remain in full force and effect, as fully as if such payment had never been made or, if prior thereto this guaranty set forth in this Section 10.01 shall have been cancelled or surrendered, the guaranty set forth in this Section 10.01 shall be reinstated in full force and effect, and such prior cancellation or surrender shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations of the U.S. Borrower in respect of the amount of such payment.

SECTION 10.03. Guaranty Absolute and Unconditional. The U.S. Borrower hereby waives any defense of a surety or guarantor or any other obligor on any obligations arising in connection with or in respect of any of the following and hereby agrees that its obligations under this Article X (Guaranty) are absolute and unconditional and shall not be discharged or otherwise affected as a result of: (a) the invalidity or unenforceability of any of any Euro Borrower’s obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any security for, or other guaranty of the Guarantied Obligations or any part of them, or the lack of perfection or continuing perfection or failure of priority of any security for the Guarantied Obligations or any part of them; (b) the absence of any attempt to collect the Guarantied Obligations or any part of them from any Euro Borrower or other action to enforce the same; (c) any Guarantied Parties’ election, in any proceeding instituted under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code; (d) any borrowing or grant of a Lien by any Euro Borrower, as debtor-in-possession, or extension of credit, under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code; (e) the disallowance, under Section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code, of all or any portion of the Administrative Agent’s or Lender’s claim (or claims) for repayment of the Guarantied Obligations; 106

SECTION 10.04. Waivers. The U.S. Borrower hereby waives diligence, promptness, presentment, demand for payment or performance and protest and notice of protest, notice of acceptance and any other notice in respect of the Guarantied Obligations or any part of them, and any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of the Euro Borrower. The U.S. Borrower shall not, until the Guarantied Obligations are irrevocably paid in full and the Commitments have been terminated, assert any claim or counterclaim it may have against any Euro Borrower or set off any of its obligations to any Euro Borrower against any obligations of any Euro Borrower to it. In connection with the foregoing, the U.S. Borrower covenants that its obligations hereunder shall not be discharged, except by complete performance. SECTION 10.05. Reliance. The U.S. Borrower hereby assumes responsibility for keeping itself informed of the financial condition of the Euro Borrowers and any and all endorsers and/or other guarantors of all or any part of the Guarantied Obligations, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guarantied Obligations, or any part thereof, that diligent inquiry would reveal, and the U.S. Borrower hereby agrees that no Guarantied Party shall have any duty to advise it of information known to it regarding such 107
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION condition or any such circumstances. In the event any Guarantied Party, in its sole discretion, undertakes at any time or from time to time to provide any such information to the U.S. Borrower, such Guarantied Party shall be under no obligation (i) to undertake any investigation not a part of its regular business routine, (ii) to disclose any information which such Guarantied Party, pursuant to accepted or reasonable commercial finance or banking practices, wishes to maintain confidential or (iii) to make any other or future disclosures of such information or any other information to any Guarantied Party. SECTION 10.06. Waiver of Subrogation and Contribution Rights. Until the Guarantied Obligations have been irrevocably paid in full and the Commitments have been terminated, the U.S. Borrower shall not enforce or otherwise exercise any right of subrogation to any of the rights of the Guarantied Parties or any part of them against any Euro Borrower or any right of reimbursement or contribution or similar right against any Euro Borrower by reason of this Agreement or by any payment made by the U.S. Borrower in respect of the obligations under this Agreement or the Notes. SECTION 10.07. Subordination. The U.S. Borrower hereby agrees that upon the occurrence of any Event of Default described in Section 7.01(e), any Indebtedness of any Euro Borrower now or hereafter owing to it, whether heretofore, now or hereafter created (the “Guaranty Subordinated Debt”), is hereby subordinated to all of the obligations under this Agreement and the Notes, and that, except as expressly permitted by this agreement, the Guaranty Subordinated Debt shall not be paid in whole or in part until such obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash and this Guaranty is terminated and of no further force or effect. The U.S. Borrower shall not accept any payment of or on account of any Guaranty Subordinated Debt at any time in contravention of the foregoing. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default described in Section 7.01(e), each Euro Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent any payment of all or any part of the Guaranty Subordinated Debt and any amount so paid to the Administrative Agent shall be applied to payment of the obligations under this Agreement and the Notes as provided herein. Each payment on the Guaranty Subordinated Debt received in violation of any of the provisions hereof shall be deemed to have been received by the U.S. Borrower as trustee for the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and shall be paid over to the Administrative Agent immediately on account of the Guarantied Obligations, but without otherwise affecting in any manner the U.S. Borrower’s liability under this Article X (Guaranty). The U.S. Borrower agrees to file all claims against the Euro Borrowers in any bankruptcy or other proceeding in which the filing of claims is required by law in respect of any Guaranty Subordinated Debt, and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to all of U.S. Borrower’s rights thereunder. If for any reason the U.S. Borrower fails to file such claim at least ten Business Days prior to the last date on which such claim should be filed, the U.S. Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact and is hereby authorized to act as attorney-in-fact in the U.S. Borrower’s name to file such claim or, in the Administrative Agent’s discretion, to assign such claim to and cause proof of claim to be filed in the name of the Administrative Agent or its nominee. In all such cases, whether in administration, bankruptcy or otherwise, the person or persons authorized to pay such claim shall pay to the Administrative Agent the full amount payable on the claim in the proceeding, and, to the full extent necessary for that purpose, the U.S. Borrower hereby assigns to the Administrative Agent all of the U.S. Borrower’s rights to any payments or distributions to which the U.S. Borrower otherwise would be entitled. If the amount so paid is greater than the U.S. Borrower’s liability hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall pay the excess amount to the party entitled thereto. 108
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION SECTION 10.08. Default; Remedies. The obligations of the U.S. Borrower hereunder are independent of and separate from the Guarantied Obligations. Upon any Event of Default, the Administrative Agent may, at its sole election, proceed directly and at once, without notice, against the U.S. Borrower to collect and recover the full amount or any portion of the Guarantied Obligations then due, without first proceeding against the defaulting Euro Borrower or Euro Borrowers or any other guarantor of the Guarantied Obligations, or joining the defaulting Euro Borrower or Euro Borrowers or any other guarantor in any proceeding against the U.S. Borrower. At any time after maturity of the Guarantied Obligations, the Administrative Agent may (unless the Guarantied Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash), without notice to the U.S. Borrower, appropriate and apply toward the payment of the Guarantied Obligations (i) any indebtedness due or to become due from any Guarantied Party to the U.S. Borrower and (ii) any moneys, credits or other property belonging to the U.S. Borrower at any time held by or coming into the possession of any Guarantied Party or any of its respective Affiliates. SECTION 10.09. Irrevocability. This Guaranty set forth in this Article X (Guaranty) shall be irrevocable as to any and all of the Guarantied Obligations until the Commitments have been terminated and all monetary Guarantied Obligations then outstanding have been indefeasibly repaid in full in cash. SECTION 10.10. Setoff. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Guarantied Party and each Affiliate thereof may, without notice to the U.S. Borrower and regardless of the acceptance of any security or collateral for the payment hereof, appropriate and apply toward the payment of all or any part of the Guarantied Obligations then due and payable (i) any indebtedness due or to become due from such Guarantied Party or Affiliate thereof to the U.S. Borrower or any Euro Borrower or Swing Loan Borrower, and (ii) any moneys, credits or other property belonging to the U.S. Borrower or any Euro Borrower or Swing Loan Borrower, at any time held by or coming into the possession of such Guarantied Party or Affiliate thereof (other than trust accounts). SECTION 10.11. No Marshaling. The U.S. Borrower consents and agrees that no Guarantied Party or Person acting for or on behalf thereof shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of the U.S. Borrower or against or in payment of any or all of the Guarantied Obligations. SECTION 10.12. Enforcement; Amendments; Waivers. No delay on the part of any Guarantied Party in the exercise of any right or remedy arising under this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or otherwise with respect to all or any part of the Guarantied Obligations or any other guaranty of or security for all or any part of the Guarantied Obligations shall operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or partial exercise by any such Person of any such right or remedy shall preclude any further exercise thereof. Failure by any Guarantied Party at any time or times hereafter to require strict performance by the U.S. Borrower, any other guarantor of all or any part of the Guarantied Obligations or any other Person of any of the provisions, warranties, terms and conditions contained in any of the Loan Documents now or at any time or times hereafter executed by such Persons and delivered to any Guarantied Party shall not waive, affect or diminish any right of such person at any time or times hereafter to demand strict performance thereof and such right shall not be deemed to have been waived by any act or knowledge of any Guarantied Party, or its Affiliates, unless such waiver is contained in an instrument in writing, directed and delivered to such Euro Borrower or the U.S. Borrower, as applicable, specifying such waiver, and is signed by the party or parties necessary to give such 109
  THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT FMC CORPORATION waiver under this Agreement. No waiver of any Event of Default shall operate as a waiver of any other Event of Default or the same Event of Default on a future occasion, and no action by any Guarantied Party permitted hereunder shall in any way affect or impair any its rights and remedies or the obligations of the U.S. Borrower under this Article X (Guaranty). Any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction of the amount of any principal and/or interest owing by any Euro Borrower to any Guarantied Party shall be conclusive and binding on the U.S. Borrower irrespective of whether the U.S. Borrower was a party to the suit or action in which such determination was made.
