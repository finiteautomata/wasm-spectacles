“Agreement” means this Credit Agreement, including any schedules and exhibits hereto, as amended by the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, the Third Amendment, the Fourth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment, and as the same may from time to time be amended, modified, supplemented or restated.
“Alternate Base Rate” means, for any day, a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect on such day plus ½ of 1% and (c) Adjusted Term SOFR for a one month Interest Period on such day (or if such day is not a Business Day, the immediately preceding Business Day) plus 1.00% (provided that clause (c) shall not be applicable during any period in which Adjusted Term SOFR is unavailable or unascertainable). Any change in the Alternate Base Rate due to a change in the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate or Adjusted Term SOFR shall be effective from and including the effective date of such change in the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate or Adjusted Term SOFR, respectively. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Alternate Base Rate be less than 1.00%.
“Applicable Margin” means, for any day, with respect to any ABR Loan or SOFR Loan, or with respect to the Commitment Fee Rate, as the case may be, the rate per annum set forth in the Borrowing Base Utilization Grid below based upon the Borrowing Base Utilization Percentage then in effect:

Borrowing Base Utilization Grid

<25%
≥25%, but
<50%
≥50%, but
<75%
≥75%, but
<90%
≥90%
ABR Loans 1.50% 1.75% 2.00% 2.25% 2.50%
SOFR Loans 2.50% 2.75% 3.00% 3.25% 3.50%
Commitment Fee Rate 0.375% 0.375% 0.50% 0.50% 0.50%

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) if the Consolidated Leverage Ratio for the Reference Period ending on the last day of any fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as applicable, is greater than 1.50 to 1.00, then the Applicable Margin set forth in the above grid with respect to ABR Loans and SOFR Loans (but, for purposes of clarity, not the Commitment Fee Rate) will, in each case, (and, for the avoidance of doubt, after giving effect to any increase in the Applicable Margin set forth in the above grid pursuant to clause (b) below) increase by 0.25% during the period from and including the first day immediately following the date the financial statements and the related compliance certificate are delivered pursuant to Section 8.01(a) or Section 8.01(b), as applicable, and Section 8.01(c) for such fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as applicable, through and including the date of delivery of the financial statements and the related compliance certificate pursuant to Section 8.01(a) or Section 8.01(b), as applicable, and Section 8.01(c) for the immediately succeeding fiscal quarter; and (b) in addition to any increase to the Applicable Margin provided in clause (a) above, if the Chisholm Acquisition Senior Notes Trigger Event shall not have occurred on or immediately prior to the Fifth Amendment Effective Date and in connection with the Chisholm Acquisition, then effective as of the Fifth Amendment Effective Date and at all times thereafter, the Applicable Margin set forth in the above grid with respect to ABR Loans and SOFR Loans (but, for purposes of clarity, not the Commitment Fee Rate) will, in each case, increase by 0.25%. Each change in the Applicable Margin and Commitment Fee Rate shall apply during the period commencing on the effective date of such change and ending on the date immediately preceding the effective date of the next such change; provided, however, that if at any time the Borrower fails to deliver (i) a Reserve Report pursuant to Section 8.11(a) or (ii) the financial statements and the related compliance certificate pursuant to Section 8.01(a) or Section 8.01(b), as applicable, and Section 8.01(c), then, if so elected by the Majority Lenders, the “Applicable Margin” means the rate per annum set forth on the grid when the Borrowing Base Utilization Percentage is at its highest level.
    In the event that the certified calculation of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio previously delivered pursuant to Section 8.01(c) was inaccurate (and such inaccuracy is discovered while any Commitments or Loans are outstanding), and such inaccuracy, if corrected, would have led to the application of a higher Applicable Margin for the Loans for any period (an “Applicable Period”) than the Applicable Margin applied for such Applicable Period, then, to the extent any Commitments or Loans are outstanding at such time, (i) the Borrower shall as soon as practicable deliver to the Administrative Agent the correct certified calculation of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio for such Applicable Period, (ii) the Applicable Margin shall be determined as if the level for such higher Applicable Margin were applicable for such Applicable Period, and (iii) the Borrower shall within ten (10) Business Days of written demand thereof by the Administrative Agent pay to the Administrative Agent the accrued additional interest owing as a result of such increased Applicable Margin for the
3    

Loans for such Applicable Period, which payment shall be promptly applied by the Administrative Agent in accordance with this Agreement.

“Benchmark” means, initially, the Term SOFR Reference Rate; provided that if a Benchmark Transition Event has occurred with respect to the Term SOFR Reference Rate or the then-current Benchmark, then “Benchmark” means the applicable Benchmark Replacement to the extent that such Benchmark Replacement has replaced such prior benchmark rate pursuant to Section 3.03(b)(i).
“Benchmark Replacement” means, with respect to any Benchmark Transition Event, the sum of: (a) the alternate benchmark rate that has been selected by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower giving due consideration to (i) any selection or recommendation of a replacement benchmark rate or the mechanism for determining such a rate by the Relevant Governmental Body or (ii) any evolving or then-prevailing market convention for determining a benchmark rate as a replacement to the then-current Benchmark for Dollar-denominated syndicated credit facilities and (b) the related Benchmark Replacement Adjustment; provided that, if such Benchmark Replacement as so determined would be less than the Floor, such Benchmark Replacement will be deemed to be the Floor for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

For the avoidance of doubt, the “Benchmark Replacement Date” will be deemed to have occurred in the case of clause (a) or (b) with respect to any Benchmark upon the occurrence of the applicable event or events set forth therein with respect to all then-current Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof).

then, in each case, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone, facsimile or electronic communication as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a SOFR Borrowing shall be ineffective, and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a SOFR Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made, as an ABR Borrowing.
(b)Benchmark Replacement Setting.
(i)Benchmark Replacement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement to replace the then-current Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement. Any such amendment with respect to a Benchmark Transition Event will become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Administrative Agent has posted such proposed amendment to all affected Lenders and the Borrower so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such amendment from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. No replacement of a Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement pursuant to this Section 3.03(b)(i)(A) will occur prior to the applicable Benchmark Transition Start Date.
(ii)Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. In connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
(iii)Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (A) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement and (B) the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes in connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower of the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to Section 3.03(b)(iv). Any determination, decision or
12    

election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 3.03(b), including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 3.03(b).
(iv)Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (A) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR Reference Rate) and either (1) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (2) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is not or will not be representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” (or any similar or analogous definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (B) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (A) above either (1) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (2) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is not or will not be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” (or any similar or analogous definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor.
(v)Benchmark Unavailability Period. Upon the Borrower’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, (A) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Loans to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a borrowing of or conversion to ABR Loans and (B) any outstanding affected SOFR Loans will be deemed to have been converted to ABR Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of the Alternate Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of the Alternate Base Rate.
1.15Amendment to Section 3.04. Section 3.04 is hereby amended by (a) replacing each instance of the word “Eurodollar” contained therein with “SOFR” and (b) replacing the phrase “three Business Days” contained therein with “three U.S. Government Securities Business Days”.
1.16Amendment to Section 3.05. Section 3.05 is hereby amended by replacing each instance of the word “Eurodollar” contained therein with “SOFR”.

13    

Section 5.01    Changes in Law. If any Change in Law shall:
(i)impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender or any Issuing Bank;
(ii)impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank any other condition (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or SOFR Loans made by such Lender or such Issuing Bank; or
(iii)subject any Lender or any Issuing Bank to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes and (B) Excluded Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, maintaining, converting or continuing any SOFR Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
1.18Amendment to Section 5.02. Section 5.02 is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any SOFR Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any SOFR Loan into an ABR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any SOFR Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto, or (d) the assignment of any SOFR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.05, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 5.02 shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error or bad faith. Except in cases of manifest error or bad faith, the Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
1.19Amendment to Section 5.06. Section 5.06 is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:
Section 5.06    Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event that it becomes unlawful for any Lender or its applicable lending office to honor its obligation to make or maintain SOFR Loans either generally or having a particular Interest Period hereunder or to determine or charge interest based upon SOFR, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Adjusted Term SOFR or Term SOFR, then (a) such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof (an “Illegality Notice”) and (i) such Lender’s obligation to make such SOFR Loans shall be suspended and (ii) if necessary to avoid such illegality, the Administrative Agent shall compute the
14    

Alternate Base Rate without reference to clause (C) of the definition of “Alternate Base Rate”, until such time as such Lender may again make and maintain such SOFR Loans. Upon receipt of an Illegality Notice, the Borrower shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, upon demand from any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all SOFR Loans to ABR Loans (in each case, if necessary to avoid such illegality, the Administrative Agent shall compute the Alternate Base Rate without reference to clause (c) of the definition of “Alternate Base Rate”), on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if all affected Lenders may lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Loans to such day, or immediately, if any Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Loans to such day. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 5.02.
1.20Amendment to Article VIII. Article VIII is hereby amended by adding a new Section 8.20 to read as follows:
Section 8.20    Fifth Amendment Post-Closing Hedging Requirement. No later than fifteen (15) days after the Fifth Amendment Effective Date (such date, the “Fifth Amendment Post-Closing Hedging Requirement Date”), the Borrower shall have entered into Swap Agreements with one or more Approved Counterparties hedging minimum notional volumes of at least fifty percent (50%) of the reasonably projected production of crude oil and natural gas, each calculated separately, from the Chisholm Acquisition Properties constituting proved developed producing Oil and Gas Properties evaluated in the Chisholm Reserve Report for each full calendar month during the period from and including the second full calendar month following the Fifth Amendment Effective Date through and including December 31, 2023. For the avoidance of doubt, the Fifth Amendment Swap Agreements shall be taken into account for purposes of determining the Borrower’s compliance with this Section 8.20.

(a)    Restricted Payments. The Borrower will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, declare or make, or agree to pay or make, directly or indirectly, any Restricted Payment, return any capital to its holders of Equity Interests or make any distribution of its Property to its Equity Interest holders without the prior approval of the Majority Lenders, except (i) each Loan Party may declare and pay dividends or distributions with respect to its Equity
15    

Interests payable solely in additional shares of its Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Capital Stock), (ii) Restricted Subsidiaries of the Borrower may declare and pay dividends or distributions ratably with respect to their Equity Interests to the Borrower or any Wholly-Owned Subsidiary Guarantor, (iii) the Permitted Parent Payments shall be permitted, (iv) the Permitted Tax Distributions shall be permitted, so long as both before and after giving effect to each such Permitted Tax Distribution, no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would result therefrom, (v) the Borrower may make Restricted Payments in cash (1) if the Chisholm Acquisition Senior Notes Trigger Event has occurred on the Fifth Amendment Effective Date, after the Fifth Amendment Effective Date, or (2) if the Chisholm Acquisition Senior Notes Trigger Event has not occurred on the Fifth Amendment Effective Date, after the date that is the earlier to occur of (x) the date on which the Chisholm Acquisition Senior Notes Trigger Event occurs and (y) the date that is 180 days immediately following the Fifth Amendment Effective Date), in each case, so long as both before and immediately after giving effect to such Restricted Payment, (A) no Default, Event of Default or Borrowing Base Deficiency has occurred and is continuing or would result therefrom, (B) the total Revolving Credit Exposures does not exceed 80% of the Loan Limit then in effect (or, until the Chisholm Acquisition Senior Notes Trigger Event shall have occurred, the total Revolving Credit Exposures does not exceed 75% of the Loan Limit then in effect) and (C) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio is equal to or less than 2.50 to 1.00 (or, until the Chisholm Acquisition Senior Notes Trigger Event shall have occurred, the Consolidated Leverage Ratio is equal to or less than 2.00 to 1.00), as the Consolidated Leverage Ratio is recomputed on such date using (I) Consolidated Total Debt outstanding on such date and (II) EBITDAX for the Reference Period ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter immediately preceding such date for which financial statements are available, and (vi) the Borrower may make Restricted Payments in cash to the Parent (each such Restricted Payment, a “Pass-Through Restricted Payment”), in each case, so long as (A) each such Pass-Through Restricted Payment is funded solely with (and in no greater amount than) the proceeds (such proceeds, the “Pass-Through Restricted Payment Related Proceeds”) of an Unrestricted Subsidiary Cash Distribution received by the Borrower or an Restricted Subsidiary on the same day as the Borrower makes such Pass-Through Restricted Payment to the Parent; and (B) the aggregate amount of each such Pass-Through Restricted Payment does not exceed the Pass-Through Restricted Payment Related Proceeds.
1.23Amendment to Section 10.01(d). Section 10.01(d) is hereby amended by replacing the reference to “Section 8.19” therein with “Section 8.19, Section 8.20”.
1.24Amendments to Exhibits. Each of Exhibit B-1 and Exhibit C is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as set forth on Exhibit B-1 and Exhibit C attached to this Fifth Amendment.
Section 3.Borrowing Base Increase. For the period from and including the Fifth Amendment Effective Date to but excluding the next Redetermination Date, the amount of the Borrowing Base shall be $825,000,000 (the “Fifth Amendment Borrowing Base Amount”); provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in the Credit Agreement, if, on the Fifth Amendment Effective Date, the Borrower does not acquire at least (i) 95% of the total value of the proved Oil and Gas Properties evaluated in the Chisholm Reserve Report and (ii) 95% of the total value of the proved developed producing Oil and Gas Properties evaluated in the Chisholm Reserve Report, pursuant to the Chisholm Acquisition Agreement, then the Fifth Amendment Borrowing Base Amount shall be reduced, effective immediately on
16    

the Fifth Amendment Effective Date (for the avoidance of doubt, prior to the funding of any Loans or any other extensions of credit to be made on the Fifth Amendment Effective Date), by an amount equal to the Borrowing Base value attributable to the proved Oil and Gas Properties evaluated in the Chisholm Reserve Report that were not acquired by the Borrower on the Fifth Amendment Effective Date, as determined by the Administrative Agent, and confirmed by the Required Lenders, in each case, in good faith and in the Administrative Agent’s and each such Lender’s sole discretion and in a manner consistent with the Administrative Agent’s and such Lender’s normal oil and gas lending criteria as it exists on the Fifth Amendment Effective Date. The Fifth Amendment Borrowing Base Amount as so reduced shall become the new Borrowing Base immediately, effective and applicable to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders on the Fifth Amendment Effective Date (for the avoidance of doubt, prior to the funding of any Loans or any other extensions of credit to be made on the Fifth Amendment Effective Date) until the next redetermination or modification thereof under the Credit Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the redetermination of the Borrowing Base to occur on the Fifth Amendment Effective Date shall not constitute a Scheduled Redetermination or an Interim Redetermination.
Section 4.Assignment and Assumption. On the Fifth Amendment Effective Date, immediately prior to giving effect to the amendments in Section 2 and the Borrowing Base adjustments contained in Section 3 of this Fifth Amendment, each Lender has, in consultation with the Borrower, agreed to, and, for an agreed consideration, does hereby reallocate its Maximum Credit Amount, Commitment and Loans (and participations in Letters of Credit and LC Disbursements) (the “Reallocation”). On the Fifth Amendment Effective Date, and after giving effect to the Reallocation, the Maximum Credit Amount and Applicable Percentage of each Lender shall be as set forth on Annex I attached to this Fifth Amendment, which Annex I supersedes and replaces Annex I to the Credit Agreement (and Annex I to the Credit Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as set forth on Annex I attached hereto). Each of the Administrative Agent, each Lender, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower hereby consents and agrees to the Reallocation, including each Lender’s assignment of its Maximum Credit Amount, Commitment, Loans and participations in Letters of Credit to the extent necessary to effect the Reallocation. With respect to the Reallocation, each Lender shall be deemed to have sold and assigned its Maximum Credit Amount, Commitment, Loans and participations in Letters of Credit, and each Lender shall be deemed to have acquired the Maximum Credit Amount, Commitment, Loans and participations in Letters of Credit allocated to it from each Lender, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Assignment and Assumption attached as Exhibit G to the Credit Agreement (the “Assignment Agreement”), as if each Lender had executed such Assignment Agreement with respect to the Reallocation, pursuant to which, (i) each Lender shall be an “Assignee”, (ii) each Lender shall be an “Assignor” and (iii) the term “Effective Date” shall be the Fifth Amendment Effective Date as defined herein. The Administrative Agent hereby waives the fee payable to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 12.04(b) of the Credit Agreement in connection with the Reallocation and the Assignment and Assumption. On the Fifth Amendment Effective Date in connection with the Reallocation, the Administrative Agent shall take the actions specified in Section 12.04(b)(iv) of the Credit Agreement, including recording the assignments described herein in the Register, and such assignments shall be effective for purposes of the Credit Agreement.
