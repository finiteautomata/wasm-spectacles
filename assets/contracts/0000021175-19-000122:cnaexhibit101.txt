Section 2.01    The Advances.
(a)    Each Lender severally agrees, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, to make Advances to the Borrower from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Effective Date until the Commitment Termination Date in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount set forth opposite such Lender’s name on Schedule I or, if such Lender has entered into an Assignment and Acceptance, set forth for such Lender in the Register, as such amount may be reduced pursuant to Section 2.04(a) or increased pursuant to Section 2.05 (such Lender’s “Commitment”).

Within the limits of each Lender’s Commitment, the Borrower may from time to time borrow, prepay pursuant to Section 2.11(b) and reborrow under this Section 2.01.

23
733301099 15483412

Section 2.02    Making the Advances.
(a)    (i)    Each Borrowing shall be made on notice, given not later than 12:00 P.M. on the third Business Day prior to the date of such Borrowing (in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar Rate Advances) or given not later than 12:00 P.M. on the Business Day of such Borrowing (in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Base Rate Advances), by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent, which shall give to each Lender prompt notice thereof.
(ii)    Each such notice of a Borrowing (a “Notice of Borrowing”) shall be in writing in substantially the form of Exhibit A, specifying therein the requested (i) date of such Borrowing, (ii) Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing, (iii) aggregate amount of such Borrowing, and (iv) in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar Rate Advances, initial Interest Period for each such Advance.
(iii)    Each Lender shall, before 1:00 P.M. on the date of such Borrowing, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Administrative Agent at its address referred to in Section 8.02, in same day funds, such Lender’s ratable portion of such Borrowing.
(iv)    After the Administrative Agent’s receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 3.02, the Administrative Agent will make such funds available to the Borrower at the Administrative Agent’s aforesaid address.
(b)    Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower. In the case of any Borrowing which the related Notice of Borrowing specifies is to be comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or expense (excluding loss of profit) reasonably incurred by such Lender as a result of any failure to make such Borrowing (including as a result of any failure to fulfill, on or before the date specified in such Notice of Borrowing, the applicable conditions set forth in Article III) and the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such Borrowing. A certificate as to the amount of such losses, costs and expenses, submitted to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent by such Lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
(c)    Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender (x) in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Base Rate Advances, prior to 1:00 P.M. on the date of such Borrowing, or (y) in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar Advances, prior to the date of such Borrowing, in each case that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s ratable portion of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a

24
733301099 15483412

corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand (but without duplication) such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to Advances comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. If such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lender’s Advance as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement (and such Advance shall be deemed to have been made by such Lender on the date on which such amount is so repaid to the Administrative Agent).
(d)    The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve the other Lenders of their obligations hereunder to make an Advance on the date of such Borrowing, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.
(e)    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Lender whose Commitment Termination Date falls prior to the last day of any Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate Advance (a “Terminating Lender”) shall participate in such Borrowing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Terminating Lender shall (i) participate in a Borrowing of any Eurodollar Rate Advance having an initial Interest Period ending after such Lender’s Commitment Termination Date, (ii) have any outstanding Eurodollar Rate Advance Continued for a subsequent Interest Period if such subsequent Interest Period would end after such Lender’s Commitment Termination Date or (iii) have any outstanding Base Rate Advance Converted into a Eurodollar Rate Advance if such Eurodollar Rate Advance would have an initial Interest Period ending after such Lender’s Commitment Termination Date. If any Terminating Lender has outstanding a Eurodollar Rate Advance that cannot be Continued for a subsequent Interest Period pursuant to clause (ii) above or has outstanding a Base Rate Advance that cannot be Converted into a Eurodollar Rate Advance pursuant to clause (iii) above, such Lender’s ratable share of such Eurodollar Rate Advance (in the case of said clause (ii)) shall be repaid by the Borrower on the last day of its then current Interest Period and such Lender’s ratable share of such Base Rate Advance (in the case of said clause (iii)) shall be repaid by the Borrower on the day on which the Advances of Lenders unaffected by said clause (iii) are so Converted.
Section 2.03    Certain Fees.
(a)    Facility Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee (the “Facility Fee”), which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the average daily amount (whether used or unused) of such Lender’s Commitment from the Effective Date (in the case of each initial Lender) and from the effective date specified in the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it became a

25
733301099 15483412

Lender (in the case of each other Lender) until the Commitment Termination Date of such Lender; provided that if such Lender continues to have any Exposure after its Commitment terminates, then its respective Facility Fee shall continue to accrue on the daily amount of such Lender’s Exposure from the Commitment Termination Date of such Lender to the date on which such Lender ceases to have any Exposure. The Facility Fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December and, for each Lender, on the Commitment Termination Date of such Lender and thereafter on demand.
(b)    Administrative Agent’s Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the Administrative Agent’s own account, an administrative agency fee at the times and in the amounts heretofore agreed between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.
(c)    All Fees. All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution to the Persons entitled thereto. Fees (other than prepaid fees) paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.
Section 2.04    Reduction and Extensions of the Commitments.
(a)    Commitment Reductions.
(i)    The Commitment of each Lender shall be automatically reduced to zero on the Commitment Termination Date of such Lender.
(ii)    In addition, the Borrower shall have the right, upon at least three Business Days’ notice to the Administrative Agent, to terminate in whole or reduce ratably in part the unused portions of the respective Commitments of the Lenders; provided that (x) the aggregate amount of the Commitments of the Lenders shall not be reduced to an amount which is less than the aggregate principal amount of the Advances then outstanding; (y) each partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; and (z) any such notice may be conditioned on the effectiveness of one or more other financing arrangements. Once reduced or terminated, the Commitments may not be reinstated.
(b)    Commitment Extensions.
(i)    The Borrower may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders) not more than 60 days and not less than 45 days prior to any anniversary of the Effective Date (each such date, an “Anniversary Date”), request that each Lender extend such Lender’s Commitment Termination Date to the date falling one year after the Commitment Termination Date then in effect for such Lender hereunder (the “Existing Commitment Termination Date”). The Borrower may exercise the extension option set forth in this Section 2.04(b)(i) not more than two times.

26
733301099 15483412

(ii)    Each Lender, acting in its sole and individual discretion, shall, by notice to the Administrative Agent given not more than 30 days immediately prior to such Anniversary Date but in any event no later than the date (the “Notice Date”) 20 days prior to such Anniversary Date, advise the Administrative Agent whether or not such Lender agrees to such extension (and each Lender that determines not to so extend its Commitment Termination Date (a “Non-Extending Lender”) shall notify the Administrative Agent (which shall notify the other Lenders) of such fact promptly after such determination (but in any event no later than the Notice Date) and any Lender that does not so advise the Administrative Agent on or before the Notice Date shall be deemed to be a Non-Extending Lender. The election of any Lender to agree to such extension shall not obligate any other Lender to so agree.
(iii)    The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of each Lender’s determination under this Section 2.04(b) no later than the date 15 days prior to such Anniversary Date (or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the next preceding Business Day).
(iv)    The Borrower shall have the right on or before any Existing Commitment Termination Date to replace each Non-Extending Lender with, and add as “Lenders” under this Agreement in place thereof, one or more Eligible Assignees (each, an “Additional Commitment Lender”) with the approval of the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), each of which Additional Commitment Lenders shall have entered into an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent pursuant to which such Additional Commitment Lender shall, effective as of the Existing Commitment Termination Date in effect for each Non-Extending Lender, undertake a Commitment (and, if any such Additional Commitment Lender is already a Lender, its Commitment shall be in addition to such Lender’s Commitment hereunder on such date); provided that prior to replacing any Non-Extending Lender with any Additional Commitment Lender, the Borrower shall have given each Lender which has agreed to extend its Commitment Termination Date an opportunity to increase its Commitment by all or a portion of the Non-Extending Lenders’ Commitments.
(v)    If (and only if) the total of the Commitments of the Lenders that have agreed so to extend their Commitment Termination Date and the additional Commitments of the Additional Commitment Lenders shall be more than 50% of the aggregate amount of the Commitments in effect immediately prior to an Anniversary Date, then, effective as of the such Anniversary Date, the Commitment Termination Date of each Extending Lender and of each Additional Commitment Lender shall be extended to the date falling one year after the Existing Commitment Termination Date in effect for such Extending Lenders and such Additional Commitment Lenders (except that, if such date is not a Business Day, such Commitment Termination Date as so extended shall be the next preceding Business Day) and each Additional Commitment Lender shall thereupon become a “Lender” for all purposes of this Agreement.

27
733301099 15483412

(vi)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the extension of the Commitment Termination Date pursuant to this Section 2.04(b) shall be effective with respect to any Lender only if:
(x)    no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on (i) the date of the notice requesting such extension, (ii) the applicable Anniversary Date or (iii) the Existing Commitment Termination Date and the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.01 shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of each of said dates as if made on and as of said dates, except that for purposes of this Section 2.04(b)(vi), the representations and warranties contained in Sections 4.01(e)(i) and (ii) shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to Section 5.01(a)(i) and (v); and
(y)    the Borrower shall have paid in full all amounts owing to each Non-Extending Lender hereunder on or before the Commitment Termination Date in effect for each such Non-Extending Lender.
Section 2.05    Increase of Commitments. The Borrower may from time to time, by written notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly deliver a copy to each of the Lenders) executed by the Borrower and one or more Lenders or other Persons qualifying as Eligible Assignees that are willing to extend Commitments or, in the case of any such Lender, to increase its Commitment (any such financial institution referred to in this Section being called an “Increasing Lender”), cause the total Commitments to be increased by such new or incremental Commitments of the Increasing Lenders, in an amount for each Increasing Lender as set forth in such notice; provided that (i) the aggregate principal amount of any increase in the total Commitments made pursuant to this Section shall be equal to $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and the aggregate principal amount of all such increases during the term of this Agreement shall not exceed $100,000,000, (ii) each Increasing Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall be subject to the prior written approval of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld) and (iii) each Increasing Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall become a party to this Agreement by completing and delivering to the Administrative Agent a duly executed accession agreement in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. New Commitments and increases in Commitments created pursuant to this Section shall become effective in the case of an Increasing Lender already a Lender under this Agreement, on the date specified in the applicable notice delivered pursuant to this Section. Upon the effectiveness of any accession agreement to which any Increasing Lender is a party, such Increasing Lender shall thereafter be deemed to be a party to this Agreement and shall be entitled to all rights, benefits and privileges accorded a Lender hereunder and subject to all obligations of a Lender hereunder. Upon the effectiveness of any increase in the Commitments pursuant to this Section, Schedule I shall be deemed to have been amended to reflect the new or increased Commitments of the Increasing Lenders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the aggregate Commitments (or in the Commitment of any Lender) shall become effective under this Section unless (i) the Administrative Agent has received a document certifying that the resolutions

28
733301099 15483412

included in the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 3.01(b) remain in full force and effect and have not been revoked and (ii) on the date of such increase, the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 3.02 shall be satisfied (with all references in such paragraphs to a Borrowing being deemed to be references to such increase and without giving effect to the parenthetical in Section 3.02(a)) and the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by a Responsible Officer. Following any extension of a new Commitment or increase of a Lender’s Commitment pursuant to this paragraph, any Advances outstanding prior to the effectiveness of such increase or extension shall continue outstanding until the ends of the respective Interests Periods applicable thereto, and shall then be repaid and, if the Borrower shall so elect, refinanced with new Advances made ratably in accordance with the Commitments in effect following such extension or increase.
Section 2.06    Repayment. The Borrower shall repay the then unpaid principal amount of each Advance made by each Lender, and each Advance made by such Lender shall mature, on the Commitment Termination Date of such Lender.

While such Advance is a Base Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus the Applicable Rate for Base Rate Advances as in effect from time to time, payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December and on the Commitment Termination Date of the Lenders that have made such Advance.
(ii)    Eurodollar Rate Advances. While such Advance is a Eurodollar Rate Advance, a rate per annum for each Interest Period for such Advance equal to the sum of the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate for Eurodollar Rate Advances as in effect from time to time, payable on the last day of such Interest Period and, if such Interest Period has a duration of more than three months, on each day which occurs at three-month intervals after the first day of such Interest Period, and on each date on which such Eurodollar Rate Advance shall be Continued, Converted or paid in full.
(b)    Default Interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Advance or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Advance, 2% per annum plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Advance as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section 2.07 or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% per annum plus the rate applicable to Base Rate Advances as provided in paragraph (a)(i) of this Section.

29
733301099 15483412

Section 2.08    Additional Interest on Eurodollar Rate Advances. The Borrower shall pay to each Lender additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Advance of such Lender, from the date of such Advance until such principal amount is paid in full, at an interest rate per annum equal at all times to the remainder obtained by subtracting (i) the Eurodollar Rate for each Interest Period for such Advance from (ii) the rate obtained by dividing such Eurodollar Rate by a percentage equal to 100% minus the Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage of such Lender for such Interest Period, payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Advance. Such additional interest shall be determined by such Lender and notified to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent.
Section 2.09    Interest Rate Determinations.
(a)    In the event the LIBOR Screen Rate is not available, each Reference Bank agrees, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, to furnish to the Administrative Agent timely information for the purpose of determining each Eurodollar Rate. If any one or more of the Reference Banks shall not furnish such timely information to the Administrative Agent for the purpose of determining any such interest rate, the Administrative Agent shall determine such interest rate on the basis of timely information furnished by the remaining Reference Banks (subject to clause (c) below).
(b)    The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower and the Lenders of the applicable interest rates determined by the Administrative Agent for the purposes of Section 2.07.
(c)    If fewer than two Reference Banks furnish timely information to the Administrative Agent for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate Advances,
(i)    the Administrative Agent shall forthwith notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the interest rate cannot be determined for such Eurodollar Rate Advances for such Interest Period,
(ii)    each Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance, and
(iii)    the obligation of the Lenders to make or Continue, or to Convert Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.
(d)    Unless and until a Benchmark Replacement Rate is implemented in accordance with clause (e) below, if, with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Advances, (1) the Administrative Agent determines that (A) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Advance or (B) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a

30
733301099 15483412

proposed Eurodollar Rate Advance for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Advance or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Advance, or (2) the Majority Lenders notify the Administrative Agent showing calculations in reasonable detail that the Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period for such Advances will not adequately reflect the cost to such Majority Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their respective Eurodollar Rate Advances for such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon:
(i)    each Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance,
(ii)    the obligation of the Lenders to make or Continue, or to Convert Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and such Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and
(iii)    the utilization of the Eurodollar Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended.

(i)    Benchmark Replacement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement to replace LIBOR with a Benchmark Replacement. Any such amendment with respect to a Benchmark Transition Event will become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Administrative Agent has posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrower so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such amendment from Lenders comprising the Majority Lenders. Any such amendment with respect to an Early Opt-in Election will become effective on the date that Lenders comprising the Majority Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Majority Lenders accept such amendment. No replacement of LIBOR with a Benchmark Replacement pursuant to this Section 2.09(e) will occur prior to the applicable Benchmark Transition Start Date.
(ii)    Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. In connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement.

(b)    If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Applicable Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Advances made by such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Lender shall notify the Borrower through the Administrative Agent that any Change in Law makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other Governmental Authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make, Convert or Continue Eurodollar Rate Advances or to fund or otherwise maintain Eurodollar Rate Advances hereunder, (i) the obligation of such Lender to make or Continue, or to Convert Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist and (ii) each Eurodollar Rate Advance of such Lender shall convert into a Base Rate Advance at the end of the then current Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Advance.
Section 2.14    Payments and Computations.
(a)    The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder without set-off or counterclaim not later than 12:00 P.M. on the day when due in U.S. dollars to the Administrative Agent at its address referred to in Section 8.02 in same day funds.

Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 8.06(d), from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, the Administrative Agent shall make all payments hereunder in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.

38
733301099 15483412

(b)    All computations of interest based on Wells Fargo’s Prime Rate shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest is payable. All other computations of interest and fees shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days, for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or fee is payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
(c)    Whenever any payment hereunder would be due on a day other than a Business Day, such due date shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and any such extension of such due date shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or fees, as the case may be; provided that if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.
(d)    Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent that the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
Section 2.15    Taxes.
(a)    Defined Terms. For purposes of this Section 2.15, the term “applicable law” includes FATCA.
(b)    Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings

39
733301099 15483412

applicable to additional sums payable under this Section), the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
(c)    Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. The Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or, at the option of the Administrative Agent, timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.
(d)    Indemnification by and to the Borrower. The Borrower hereby indemnifies each Recipient, within ten days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. Promptly upon having knowledge that any such Indemnified Taxes have been levied, imposed or assessed, and promptly upon notice by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, the Borrower shall pay such Indemnified Taxes directly to the relevant taxing authority or Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower hereby indemnifies the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within ten days after demand therefor, for any amount which a Lender for any reason fails to pay indefeasibly to the Administrative Agent as required by Section 2.15(e). Each Lender shall indemnify the Borrower, and shall make payment in respect thereof, within ten days after demand therefor, for any amount that the Borrower is required to pay to the Administrative Agent pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.
(e)    Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within ten days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 8.06(e) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with this Agreement, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this clause (e).

40
733301099 15483412

(f)    Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.15, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(g)    Status of Lenders. (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made hereunder shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Sections 2.15(g)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(C) and 2.15(h) below) shall not be required if, in the Lender’s reasonable judgment, such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
(ii)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Person,
(A)    any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;
(B)    any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient), on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
(1)    in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party, (x) with respect to payments of interest under this Agreement, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form

41
733301099 15483412

(2)    executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;
(3)    in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable; or
(4)    to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-2 or Exhibit F-3, IRS Form W-9 and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that, if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; and
(C)    any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient), on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.

42
733301099 15483412

(h)    Documentation Required by FATCA. If a payment made to a Lender hereunder would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (h), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(i)    Treatment of Certain Refunds. Unless required by applicable law, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of any Recipient, or have any obligation to pay to any Recipient, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Recipient, as the case may be. If any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.15 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.15), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such Recipient, shall repay to such Recipient the amount paid over pursuant to this clause (i) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this clause (i), in no event will a Recipient be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this clause (i) the payment of which would place such Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This clause (i) shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
(j)    Survival. Each party’s obligations under this Section 2.15 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Advances and other obligations hereunder.
(k)    Updates. Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.15 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any

43
733301099 15483412

respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
Section 2.16    Set-Off; Sharing of Payments, Etc.
(a)    Without limiting any of the obligations of the Borrower or the rights of the Lenders hereunder, if the Borrower shall fail to pay when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) any amount payable by it hereunder or under any Note, each Lender may, without prior notice to the Borrower (which notice is expressly waived by it to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law), set off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in any currency, matured or unmatured) and other obligations and liabilities at any time held or owing by such Lender or any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or account of the Borrower, provided that in the event any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.20 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of set-off. Each Lender shall promptly provide notice of such set-off to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, provided that failure by such Lender to provide such notice shall not give the Borrower any cause of action or right to damages or affect the validity of such set-off and application.
(b)    If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Advances made by it (other than pursuant to Section 2.02(b), 2.12, 2.15 or 8.04(d)) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Advances obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall (i) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (ii) forthwith purchase (for cash at face value) from the other Lenders such participations in the Advances made by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided however that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The provisions of this Section 2.16 shall not be construed to apply to (y) any payment made by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender or Disqualified Institution) or (z) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Advances to any assignee or participant, other than an assignment to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this

44
733301099 15483412

Section 2.16 shall apply). The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.16 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
Section 2.17    Right to Replace a Lender. If (a) the Borrower is required to make any additional payment pursuant to Section 2.12 or Section 2.15 to any Lender, (b) any Lender’s obligation to make or Continue, or to Convert Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended pursuant to Section 2.13, (c) any Lender is a Non-Consenting Lender or (d) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender (any Lender described in clauses (a) through (d), an “Affected Person”), the Borrower may elect to replace such Affected Person as a party to this Agreement; provided that, concurrently with such replacement, (i) another financial institution that is an Eligible Assignee and is reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall agree, as of such date, to purchase for cash the Advances of the Affected Person pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance, to become a Lender for all purposes under this Agreement (if it is not already a Lender) and to assume all obligations (including all outstanding Advances) of the Affected Person to be terminated as of such date and to comply with the requirements of Section 8.06 applicable to assignments, (ii) the Administrative Agent shall receive the processing and recordation fee specified in Section 8.06 and (iii) the Borrower shall pay to such Affected Person in same day funds on the day of such replacement all interest, fees and other amounts then due and owing to such Affected Person by the Borrower hereunder to and including the date of termination, including payments due such Affected Person under Section 2.12 and Section 2.15. No replacement of a Lender shall be deemed to be a waiver of any right that the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender hereunder or in connection herewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in the case of any replacement of an Affected Person under this Section 2.17 resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.12 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.15, such Affected Person may only be replaced hereunder if such replacement will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments made thereafter and (ii) in the case of any assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent.
Section 2.18    Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.12, or requires the Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15, then such Lender shall (at the request of the Borrower) use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Advances hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.12 or 2.15, as the case may be, in the future, and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

45
733301099 15483412

Section 2.19    Evidence of Indebtedness.
(a)    Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Advance made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
(b)    The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the date, amount, Type, interest rate and duration of Interest Period (if applicable) of each Advance made hereunder, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender’s share thereof.
(c)    The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to clause (a) or (b) of this Section 2.19 shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Advances in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(d)    Any Lender may request that Advances made by it be evidenced by a promissory note (a “Note”). In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a Note in the form of Exhibit E, which shall evidence such Lender’s Advances in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Advances and payments with respect thereto.
Section 2.20    Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then to the extent permitted by applicable law, the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
(a)    Waivers and Amendments. Such Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Majority Lenders and in the second paragraph of Section 8.01.
(b)    Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Borrowing in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s future funding obligations with respect to

46
733301099 15483412

Borrowings under this Agreement; fourth, to the payment of any amount owing to any other Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by such other Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; fifth, to the payment of any amount owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and sixth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Borrowing in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y) the Advances comprising such Borrowing were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 3.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Advances of all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Advances of such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Advances are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments (after which the balance, if any, of such payment shall be applied in accordance with the waterfall set forth above). Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section 2.20(b) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
(c)    Certain Fees. Such Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to receive any Facility Fee for any period during which such Lender is a Defaulting Lender except to the extent allocable to the sum of (1) the outstanding principal amount of the Advances funded by it and (2) the amount of its unused Commitment for which it has provided cash collateral pursuant to the immediately following subsection (d).
(d)    Cash Collateral. Upon request of the Borrower (with the consent of the Administrative Agent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld), such Defaulting Lender shall deposit, and maintain with the Administrative Agent so long as it is a Defaulting Lender, cash in an amount equal to its unused Commitment to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s funding obligations with respect to Borrowings under this Agreement (it being understood that the Administrative Agent shall promptly return such cash to such Lender (i) to the extent the amount on deposit exceeds such Defaulting Lender’s unused Commitment and (ii) if such Lender ceases to be a Defaulting Lender). Such Defaulting Lender hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all cash collateral held by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this clause (d).
(e)    Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrower and the Administrative Agent agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein, such Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Advances of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause all Borrowings to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with their

47
733301099 15483412

respective Commitments, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that (i) except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lender having been a Defaulting Lender; and (ii) no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender.

All financial projections that have been prepared by the Borrower and made available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement have been prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time of preparation and delivery (it being understood that such projected information may vary from actual results and that such variances may be material). There is no fact known to the Borrower (other than matters of a general economic nature) that has had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material

ARTICLE VII
THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
Section 7.01    Appointment and Authority. Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints Wells Fargo to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article VII are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and the Borrower shall not have rights as a third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term “agent” herein (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.
Section 7.02    Rights as a Lender. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for, and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
Section 7.03    Exculpatory Provisions.
(a)    The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent:
(i)    shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;
(ii)    shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Majority Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein); provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to this Agreement or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor

62
733301099 15483412

Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and
(iii)    shall not, except as expressly set forth herein, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.
(b)    The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Majority Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 8.01 and 6.01), or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until notice describing such Default or Event of Default and indicating that such notice is a “Notice of Default” is given to the Administrative Agent in writing by the Borrower or a Lender.
(c)    The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article 3 or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
(d)    Other than as set forth in Section 8.06(i)(iv), the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible or have any liability for, or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, monitor or enforce, compliance with the provisions hereof relating to Disqualified Institutions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall not (x) be obligated to ascertain, monitor or inquire as to whether any Lender or Participant or prospective Lender or Participant is a Disqualified Institution or (y) have any liability with respect to or arising out of any assignment or participation of Advances, or disclosure of confidential information, to any Disqualified Institution.
Section 7.04    Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition

63
733301099 15483412

hereunder to the making of an Advance that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Advances. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
Section 7.05    Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facility established hereunder as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents.
Section 7.06    Successor Administrative Agent.
(a)    The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving 30 days written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Majority Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent that, unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and then be continuing, is reasonably acceptable to the Borrower. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Majority Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent’s giving of notice of resignation (the “Resignation Effective Date”), then the retiring Administrative Agent may(but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof and having total assets of at least $1,000,000,000; provided that in no event shall any such successor Administrative Agent be a Defaulting Lender or a Disqualified Institution. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date.
(b)    If the Person serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (e) of the definition thereof, the Majority Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Borrower and such Person remove such Person as Administrative Agent and appoint a successor; provided that such appointment shall be subject to the approval of the Borrower (which shall not be unreasonably withheld and shall not be required if an Event of Default exists). If no such

64
733301099 15483412

successor shall have been so appointed by the Majority Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Majority Lenders and, so long as no Event of Default exists, the Borrower) (the “Removal Effective Date”), then (i) such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date and (ii) the Borrower may, on behalf of the Lenders (and subject to the approval of the Majority Lenders, which shall not be unreasonably withheld), appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall meet the qualifications set forth in the last sentence of Section 7.06(a). If at any time there is no Administrative Agent, then all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time as a successor Administrative Agent has been appointed and accepted such appointment.
(c)    With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable), (i) the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other documents delivered hereunder (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders hereunder, the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (ii) except for any indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time, if any, as the Majority Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance by a successor of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Administrative Agent (other than any rights to indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) under this Agreement or any document delivered in connection herewith. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as (but not in duplication of) those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After any retiring or removed Administrative Agent’s resignation or removal hereunder, the provisions of this Article VII and Section 8.04 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective related Indemnified Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or removed Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.
Section 7.07    Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their officers,

65
733301099 15483412

directors, employees, agents, and representatives and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
Section 7.08    No Other Duties, Etc. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Arrangers, syndication or documentation agents listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent or a Lender hereunder.
Section 7.09    Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Advance shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated) by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:
(a)    to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Advances and all other obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.03 and 8.04) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and
(b)    to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.03 and 8.04.
Section 7.10    Certain ERISA Matters.
(a) Each Lender (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of the Borrower, that at least one of the following is and will be true:
(i)such Lender is not using “plan assets” (within the meaning of Section 3(42) of ERISA or otherwise) of one or more Benefit Plans with respect to such

(iii)(A) such Lender is an investment fund managed by a “Qualified Professional Asset Manager” (within the meaning of Part VI of PTE 84-14), (B) such Qualified Professional Asset Manager made the investment decision on behalf of such Lender to enter into, participate in, administer and perform the Advances, the Commitments and this Agreement, (C) the entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Advances, the Commitments and this Agreement satisfies the requirements of sub-sections (b) through (g) of Part I of PTE 8414 and (D) to the best knowledge of such Lender, the requirements of subsection (a) of Part I of PTE 84-14 are satisfied with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Advances, the Commitments and this Agreement, or
(iv) such other representation, warranty and covenant as may be agreed in writing between the Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, and such Lender.
(b) In addition, unless either (1) sub-clause (i) in the immediately preceding clause (a) is true with respect to a Lender or (2) a Lender has provided another representation, warranty and covenant in accordance with sub-clause (iv) in the immediately preceding clause (a), such Lender further (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of the Borrower, that the Administrative Agent is not a fiduciary with respect to the assets of such Lender involved in such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Advances, the Commitments and this Agreement (including in connection with the reservation or exercise of any rights by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any documents related hereto or thereto).

(d)    THE PLATFORM IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT DOES NOT WARRANT THE ADEQUACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE PLATFORM AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR ERRORS IN OR OMISSIONS FROM THE COMMUNICATIONS EFFECTED THEREBY. NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH COMMUNICATIONS OR THE PLATFORM.

70
733301099 15483412

arising out of the transmission of any notices or communications through the Platform, other than for direct or actual damages resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent, or any of its Affiliates as determined by a final and nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.
Section 8.03    No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.
Section 8.04    Costs, Expenses and Indemnification.
(a)    The Borrower agrees to pay and reimburse on demand all reasonable and documented costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent and the Arrangers in connection with (i) the arrangement and syndication of the credit facility established hereby and (ii) the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification and amendment of this Agreement and the other documents to be delivered hereunder, including the reasonable and documented fees and out-of-pocket expenses of a single counsel for the Administrative Agent and the Arrangers with respect thereto and with respect to advising the Administrative Agent as to its rights and responsibilities under this Agreement. The Borrower further agrees to pay on demand all reasonable and documented costs and expenses, if any (including reasonable and documented counsel fees and expenses of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders), incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of this Agreement and the other documents to be delivered hereunder, including reasonable and documented counsel fees and expenses in connection with the enforcement of rights under this Section 8.04(a); provided that the Borrower will be responsible for the fees and expenses of only one counsel for the Lenders (in addition to counsel for the Administrative Agent) except to the extent that such counsel determines that a conflict of interest requires separate counsel.
(b)    The Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Arranger, each Lender and each of their respective Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and representatives (each, an “Indemnified Party”) from and against any and all direct claims, damages, losses, liabilities, penalties and reasonable and documented expenses (including reasonable and documented fees and disbursements of counsel), joint or several, that may be incurred by or asserted or awarded against any Indemnified Party, in each case arising out of or in connection with or relating to any investigation, litigation or proceeding or the preparation of any defense with respect thereto arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or any use made or proposed to be made with the proceeds of the Advances, whether or not such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by the Borrower, any of its shareholders or creditors, an Indemnified Party or any other Person, or an Indemnified Party is otherwise a party thereto, and whether or not any

71
733301099 15483412

of the conditions precedent set forth in Article 3 are satisfied or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, except to the extent such direct claims, damages, losses, liabilities, penalties or expenses (x) are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party, (y) result from a claim brought by the Borrower against an Indemnifed Party for breach in bad faith of such Indemnified Party’s obligations hereunder, if the Borrower has obtained a final and nonappealable judgment in its favor on such claim as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or (z) result from a claim not involving an act or omission of the Borrower and that is brought by an Indemnified Party against another Indemnified Party (other than against an Arranger or the Administrative Agent in their capacities as such).
The Borrower hereby further agrees that no Indemnified Party shall have any liability (whether direct or indirect, in contract, tort or otherwise) to the Borrower for or in connection with or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any use made or proposed to be made with the proceeds of the Advances, except to the extent such liability is found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert and the Borrower hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnified Party, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
(c)    To the extent that the Borrower for any reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof) or any director, officer, employee, agent, affiliate, advisor or representative thereof of any of the foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or such director, officer, employee, agent, affiliate, advisor or representative thereof, as the case may be, such Lender’s pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought based on each Lender’s share of the aggregate Exposures at such time) of such unpaid amount (including any such unpaid amount in respect of a claim asserted by such Lender), provided, that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) in its capacity as such, or against any director, officer, employee, agent, affiliate, advisor or representative of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) in connection with such capacity.
(d)    If any payment of principal of, or Conversion or Continuation of, any Eurodollar Rate Advance is made other than on the last day of an Interest Period for such Advance as a result of any optional or mandatory prepayment, acceleration of the maturity of the Advances pursuant to Section 6.01 or for any other reason, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender any amounts

72
733301099 15483412

required to compensate such Lender for any additional losses, costs or expenses (other than loss of profit) which it may reasonably incur as a result of such payment, Continuation or Conversion and the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by any Lender to fund or maintain such Advance. A certificate as to the amount of such losses, costs and expenses, submitted to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent by such Lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
Section 8.05    Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by each Lender that such Lender has executed it and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Lender and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except that the Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the Lenders.
Section 8.06    Assignments and Participations.
(a)    Each Lender may assign to one or more banks or other entities, with notice to and the consent of the Administrative Agent and, unless (i) an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or (ii) such assignment is to an existing Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, the Borrower (such consents not to be unreasonably withheld), all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Advances owing to it); provided that:
(i)    each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not a varying, percentage of all rights and obligations of the assigning Lender under this Agreement,
(ii)    except in the case of an assignment by a Lender to one of its Affiliates or to another Lender, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender being assigned pursuant to each such assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment) shall in no event (unless the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise agree) be less than the lesser of (x) such Lender’s Commitment hereunder and (y) $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof,
(iii)    each such assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee,
(iv)    the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance, and
(v)    the parties to each such assignment (other than the Borrower) shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a processing and recordation fee of $3,500.

73
733301099 15483412

Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder and (y) the Lender assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto).
(b)    By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the Lender assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of the Borrower or the performance or observance by the Borrower of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the financial statements referred to in Section 4.01 and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms that it is an Eligible Assignee; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as administrative agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.
(c)    Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee representing that it is an Eligible Assignee, the Administrative Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has been completed (and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall have consented to the relevant assignment) and is in substantially the form of Exhibit B, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower.
(d)    The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at its address referred to in Section 8.02 a copy of

74
733301099 15483412

each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of each of the Lenders and, with respect to Lenders, the Commitment of, and principal amount (and stated interest) of the Advances owing to, each such Lender from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for the purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(e)    Each Lender may sell participations to one or more Persons (excluding any Persons primarily engaged in the insurance or mutual fund business) in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Advances owing to it) (each, a “Participant”); provided, however, that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement (including its Commitment to the Borrower hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, (iv) in any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law in respect of the Borrower, such Lender shall remain and be, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole representative with respect to the rights and obligations held in the name of such Lender (whether such rights or obligations are for such Lender’s own account or for the account of any participant) and (v) no participant under any such participation agreement shall have any right to approve any amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, or to consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom, except to the extent that any such amendment, waiver or consent would (x) reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Advances, in each case to the extent the same are subject to such participation, or (y) postpone any date fixed for the payment of principal of, or interest on, the Advances, in each case to the extent the same are subject to such participation. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Advances or other obligations hereunder (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, loans, or its other obligations hereunder) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.

75
733301099 15483412

(f)    Any Lender may, in connection with any permitted assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 8.06 and subject to the provisions of Section 8.12, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower.
(g)    Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
(h)    Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement, any Lender may at any time, without the consent of the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, assign to an Affiliate of such Lender (excluding any Affiliate of such Lender primarily engaged in the insurance or mutual fund business) all or any portion of its rights (but not its obligations) under this Agreement.
(i)    (i) No assignment or participation shall be made to any Person that was a Disqualified Institution as of the date (the “DQ Trade Date”) on which the assigning Lender entered into a binding agreement to sell and assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to such Person (unless the Borrower has consented to such assignment in writing in its sole and absolute discretion, in which case such Person will not be considered a Disqualified Institution for the purpose of such assignment or participation). For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any assignee that becomes a Disqualified Institution after the applicable DQ Trade Date (including as a result of the delivery of a notice pursuant to, and/or the expiration of the notice period referred to in, the definition of “Disqualified Institution”), (x) such assignee shall not retroactively be disqualified from becoming a Lender and (y) the execution by the Borrower of an Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignee will not by itself result in such assignee no longer being considered a Disqualified Institution. Any assignment in violation of this clause shall not be void, but the other provisions of this clause shall apply.
(ii)    If any assignment or participation is made to any Disqualified Institution without the Borrower’s prior written consent in violation of clause (i) above, or if any Person becomes a Disqualified Institution after the applicable DQ Trade Date, the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to the applicable Disqualified Institution and the Administrative Agent, (A) terminate the Commitment of such Disqualified Institution and repay all obligations of the Borrower owing to such Disqualified Institution in connection with such Commitment, and/or (B) require such Disqualified Institution to assign, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in this Section 8.06), all of its interest, rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more Eligible Assignees at the lesser of (x) the principal amount thereof and (y) the amount that such Disqualified Institution paid to acquire such

76
733301099 15483412

interests, rights and obligations, in each case plus accrued interest, accrued fees and all other amounts (other than principal amounts) payable to it hereunder.
(iii)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Disqualified Institutions (A) will not (x) have the right to receive information, reports or other materials provided to Lenders by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, (y) attend or participate in meetings attended by the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, or (z) access any electronic site established for the Lenders or confidential communications from counsel to or financial advisors of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders and (B) (x) for purposes of any consent to any amendment, waiver or modification of, or any action under, and for the purpose of any direction to the Administrative Agent or any Lender to undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action) under this Agreement, each Disqualified Institution will be deemed to have consented in the same proportion as the Lenders that are not Disqualified Institutions consented to such matter, and (y) for purposes of voting on any plan of reorganization or plan of liquidation pursuant to any Debtor Relief Laws (a “Plan”), each Disqualified Institution party hereto hereby agrees (1) not to vote on such Plan, (2) if such Disqualified Institution does vote on such Plan notwithstanding the restriction in the foregoing clause (1), such vote will be deemed not to be in good faith and shall be “designated” pursuant to Section 1126(e) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision in any other Debtor Relief Laws), and such vote shall not be counted in determining whether the applicable class has accepted or rejected such Plan in accordance with Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision in any other Debtor Relief Laws) and (3) not to contest any request by any party for a determination by the applicable bankruptcy court (or other applicable court of competent jurisdiction) effectuating the foregoing clause (2).
(iv)    The Administrative Agent may, and upon request from any Lender shall, and the Borrower hereby expressly authorizes the Administrative Agent to (A) post the list of Disqualified Institutions provided by the Borrower and any updates thereto from time to time (collectively, the “DQ List”) on the Platform and/or (B) provide the DQ List to each Lender requesting the same.
Section 8.07    Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of New York. The Borrower hereby submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and of any New York state court sitting in New York City for the purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Borrower irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 8.02. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

77
733301099 15483412

Section 8.08    Severability. In case any provision in this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be severable from the rest of this Agreement, as the case may be, and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
Section 8.09    Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Any counterpart hereof may be executed and delivered via telecopier or e-mail (in a pdf or similar file), and each such counterpart so executed and delivered shall have the same force and effect as an originally executed and delivered counterpart hereof.
Section 8.10    Survival. The obligations of the Borrower under Sections 2.02(b), 2.08, 2.12, 2.15 and 8.04, and the obligations of the Lenders under Section 7.05, shall survive the repayment of the Advances and the termination of the Commitments. In addition, each representation and warranty made, or deemed to be made by any Notice of Borrowing, herein or pursuant hereto shall survive the making of such representation and warranty, and no Lender shall be deemed to have waived, by reason of making any Advance, any Default or Event of Default that may arise by reason of such representation or warranty proving to have been false or misleading, notwithstanding that such Lender or the Administrative Agent may have had notice or knowledge or reason to believe that such representation or warranty was false or misleading at the time such extension of credit was made.
Section 8.11    Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE LENDERS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
Section 8.12    Confidentiality. Each Lender agrees to hold any confidential information which it may receive from the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement in confidence and for use in connection with this Agreement, including for use in connection with its rights and remedies hereunder, except for disclosure (a) to its Affiliates and to its legal counsel, accountants, and other professional advisors and (provided that they are advised of the confidential nature of the information and obligated to keep such information confidential) to its and its Affiliates’ directors, officers, employees, agents, and advisors, (b) to the extent required or requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over such Person or its Affiliates, (c) as requested pursuant to or as required by law, regulation, or legal process, (d) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (e) to a proposed assignee or participant permitted under Section 8.06 which shall have agreed in writing for the benefit of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to keep such disclosed confidential information confidential in accordance with this Section, (f) on a confidential

733301099 15483412

basis to the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar agency in connection with the issuance and monitoring of CUSIP numbers or other market identifiers with respect to the credit facilities provided hereunder, (g) with the consent of the Borrower, (h) to any actual or prospective party to any swap, derivative or other transaction under which payments are to be made by reference to the Borrower and its obligations, this Agreement or payments hereunder which shall have agreed in writing for the benefit of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to keep such disclosed confidential information confidential in accordance with this Section or (i) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (y) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower to the extent such source did not obtain or disclose such information in violation of any confidentiality agreement.
Section 8.13    Nonliability of Lenders; No Fiduciary Relationship.
(a)    The relationship between the Borrower and the Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall be solely that of borrower and lender. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender undertakes any responsibility to the Borrower to review or inform the Borrower of any matter in connection with any phase of the Borrower’s business or operations.
(b)    The Borrower, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, agrees that in connection with all aspects of the transactions contemplated hereby and any communications in connection therewith, the Borrower, its Subsidiaries and their Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and their Affiliates, on the other hand, will have a business relationship that does not create, by implication or otherwise, any fiduciary duty on the part of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any of their Affiliates, and no such duty will be deemed to have arisen in connection with any such transactions or communications.
Section 8.14    USA Patriot Act. Each Lender hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to identify the Borrower in accordance with the Patriot Act.

The words “execute,” “execution,” “signed,” “signature,” and words of like import in or related to any document to be signed in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including without limitation Assignment and Acceptances, amendments or other modifications, Notices of Borrowing, waivers and consents) shall be deemed to include electronic signatures, the electronic matching of assignment terms and contract formations on electronic platforms approved by the Administrative Agent, or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the

79
733301099 15483412

Section 8.16    Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of EEA Financial Institutions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any EEA Financial Institution arising under this Agreement, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the write-down and conversion powers of an EEA Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:
(a)    the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by an EEA Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder that may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an EEA Financial Institution; and
(b)    the effects of any Bail-in Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:
(i)    a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;
(ii)    a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such EEA Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement; or
(iii)    the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of any EEA Resolution Authority.
Section 8.17    Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs. To the extent that this Agreement provides support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for hedge agreements or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, “QFC Credit Support” and each such QFC a “Supported QFC”), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the “U.S. Special Resolution Regimes”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that this Agreement and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States):
(a)    In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “Covered Party”) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support

80
733301099 15483412

(and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under this Agreement that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and this Agreement were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.
(b)    As used in this Section 8.17, the following terms have the following meanings:
“BHC Act Affiliate” of a party means an “affiliate” (as such term is defined under, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 1841(k)) of such party.
“Covered Entity” means any of the following:

[Form of Opinion of Counsel of the Borrower]
[Date]
To the Lenders party to the
Credit Agreement referred to
below
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association,
as Administrative Agent
550 South Tryon Street, 33rd Floor
Charlotte, North Carolina, 28202
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I have acted as counsel to CNA Financial Corporation (the “Borrower”) in connection with the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) dated as of December 19, 2019, among the Borrower, the Lenders named therein and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, providing for Advances to be made by said Lenders to the Borrower in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding $250,000,000. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used in this opinion letter as defined therein. This opinion letter is being delivered pursuant to Section 3.01(e) of the Credit Agreement.
In rendering the opinion expressed below, I, or attorneys under my supervision, have examined the following agreements, instruments and other documents:
(a)
the Credit Agreement; and
(b)    such corporate records of the Borrower and such other documents as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions expressed below.
In my examination, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures (other than those of the Borrower), the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity with authentic original documents of all documents submitted to me as copies. When relevant facts were not independently established, I have relied upon certificates of governmental officials and appropriate representatives of the Borrower and upon representations made in or pursuant to the Credit Agreement.
In rendering the opinions expressed below, I have assumed, with respect to all of the documents referred to in this opinion letter, that (except, to the extent set forth in the opinions expressed below, as to the Borrower):


733301099 15483412
Opinion of Counsel of the Borrower

- 6-

(i)
such documents have been duly authorized by, have been duly executed and delivered by, and constitute legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of, all of the parties to such documents;
(ii)
all signatories to such documents have been duly authorized; and
(iii)
all of the parties to such documents are duly organized and validly existing and have the power and authority (corporate or other) to execute, deliver and perform such documents.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing and subject also to the comments and qualifications set forth below, and having considered such questions of law as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions expressed below, I am of the opinion that:
1.    The Borrower is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
2.    The Borrower has all requisite corporate power to execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations and to incur liabilities under, the Credit Agreement.
3.    The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of, and the incurrence by the Borrower of liabilities under, the Credit Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Borrower.
4.    The Credit Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower.
5.    The Credit Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally and except as the enforceability of the Credit Agreement is subject to the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), including (a) the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy and (b) concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.
6.    No authorization, approval or consent of, and no filing or registration with, any governmental or regulatory authority or agency of the United States of America or the State of New York is required on the part of the Borrower for the execution, delivery or performance by the Borrower of, or for the incurrence by the Borrower of any liabilities under, the Credit Agreement.
7.    The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of, and the consummation by the Borrower of the transactions contemplated by, the Credit Agreement do not and will not (a) violate any provision of the charter or

733301099 15483412
Opinion of Counsel of the Borrower

- 7-

by-laws of the Borrower, (b) violate any applicable law, rule or regulation of the United States of America (including Regulations T, U and X) or the State of New York, (c) violate any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or governmental authority or agency or any arbitral award applicable to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of which I have knowledge (after due inquiry) or (d) result in a breach of, constitute a default under, require any consent under, or result in the acceleration or required prepayment of any indebtedness pursuant to the terms of, any agreement or instrument of which I have knowledge (after due inquiry) to which the Borrower and its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound or to which any of them is subject, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any property of the Borrower pursuant to the terms of any such agreement or instrument.
8.    Other than as disclosed in filings of the Borrower with the Securities and Exchange Commission, I have no knowledge (after due inquiry) of any legal or arbitral proceedings, or any proceedings by or before any governmental or regulatory authority or agency, now pending or threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Properties that, if adversely determined, could have a Material Adverse Effect.
9.    The Borrower is not an “investment company”, or a Person “controlled by” an “investment company”, as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940.
The foregoing opinions are subject to the following comments and qualifications:
(a)    The enforceability of Section 8.04(b) of the Credit Agreement may be limited by laws limiting the enforceability of provisions exculpating or exempting a party from, or requiring indemnification of a party for, its own action or inaction, to the extent such action or inaction involves gross negligence, recklessness or willful or unlawful conduct.
(b)    The enforceability of provisions in the Credit Agreement to the effect that terms may not be waived or modified except in writing may be limited under certain circumstances.
(c)    I express no opinion as to (i) the effect of the laws of any jurisdiction in which any Lender is located (other than the State of New York) that limit the interest, fees or other charges such Lender may impose, (ii) Section 2.16 of the Credit Agreement, (iii) the second sentence of Section 8.07 of the Credit Agreement, insofar as such sentence relates to the subject matter jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to adjudicate any controversy related to the Credit Agreement, (iv) the waiver of inconvenient forum set forth in Section 8.07 of the Credit Agreement with respect

733301099 15483412
Opinion of Counsel of the Borrower

- 8-

to proceedings in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and (v) Section 8.08 of the Credit Agreement.
The foregoing opinions are limited to matters involving the Federal laws of the United States, the law of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and I do not express any opinion as to the laws of any other jurisdiction. The opinions expressed herein are as of the date hereof. I assume no obligation to update or supplement this opinion letter to reflect any facts or circumstances that may hereafter come to my attention or any changes in applicable law that may hereafter occur.
At the request of the Borrower, this opinion letter is, pursuant to Section 3.01(e) of the Credit Agreement, provided to you by me in my capacity as Counsel of the Borrower and may not be relied upon by any Person for any purpose other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement without, in each instance, my prior written consent. The opinions contained herein are limited to the matters expressly stated herein, and no opinion may be inferred or implied beyond the matters expressly stated herein.
Very truly yours,
