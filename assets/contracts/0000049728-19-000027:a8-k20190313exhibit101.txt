WHEREAS, Borrower has requested and the Lender has agreed to make certain amendments to the Credit Agreement, all on the terms and conditions herein set forth.
NOW, THEREFORE, for due consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:
1.    DEFINITIONS. All capitalized terms used herein and not defined shall have the meaning given such terms in the Credit Agreement.
    2.    AMENDMENTS. Effective as of the date of this Amendment:
(A)     Section 1.1 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by amending and restating the following definition in its entirety to read as follows:
““Borrowing Base” means, at any time, an amount equal to the sum of (a) eighty-five percent (85%) of the Eligible Accounts of the Credit Parties; plus (b) (i) from the Third Amendment Closing Date until the first Advance Rate Reset, the lesser of (A) thirty-five percent (35%) of Eligible Inventories (excluding work in process) and (B) Three Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($3,750,000), and (ii) upon each Advance Rate Reset, the lesser of (A) eighty-five percent (85%) of the then updated Eligible Inventory NOLV and (B) Fourteen Million Dollars ($14,000,000), minus (c) Reserves.
The Borrowing Base shall be computed based on the Borrowing Base Report required by this Agreement and most recently delivered to and accepted by the Lender in its sole and absolute discretion. In the event the Borrower fails to furnish a Borrowing Base Report, or in the event the Lender believes that a Borrowing Base Report is no longer accurate, valid, or current (with current defined as information provided aged no more than forty-five (45) days) the Lender may, in its sole and absolute discretion exercised from time to time and without limiting other rights and remedies under this Agreement, suspend the making of or limit Revolving Credit Loans. The Borrowing Base shall be subject to reduction by the amount of Reserves applicable from


Exhibit 10.1

time to time, and by the amount of any Account or any Inventory that was included in the Borrowing Base but that the Lender determines fails to meet the respective criteria applicable from time to time for Eligible Accounts or Eligible Inventories.
Without implying any limitation on the Lender’s discretion with respect to the Borrowing Base, the criteria for Eligible Accounts and for Eligible Inventories contained in the respective definitions of Eligible Accounts and of Eligible Inventories are in part based upon the business operations of the Credit Parties existing on or about the Closing Date and upon information and records furnished to the Lender by the Credit Parties. If at any time or from time to time hereafter, the business operations of one or more of the Credit Parties change or such information and records furnished to the Lender is incorrect or misleading, the Lender in its discretion, may at any time and from time to time during the duration of this Agreement change such criteria or add new criteria. The Lender will communicate such changed or additional criteria to the Borrower from time to time, which communication shall be either orally or in writing.”
(B) Section 1.1 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by adding the following definition thereto:
““Eighth Amendment Closing Date” means March 11, 2019.”
