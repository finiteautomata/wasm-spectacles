(a)    Each Bank severally agrees, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, to make Revolving Credit Advances in any Agreed Currency to Caterpillar and CFSC from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Closing Date until the Revolving Credit Termination Date in a Dollar Amount not to exceed such Bank’s Available Revolving Credit Commitment at such time; provided, however, that at no time shall the Dollar Amount of (i) the outstanding Advances exceed the Total Commitment, (ii) the Revolving Credit Obligations exceed the Total Revolving Credit Commitment, (iii) any Bank’s Revolving Credit Advances, Local Currency Advances and Japan Local Currency Advances exceed such Bank’s Commitment, (iv) all Revolving Credit Advances to Caterpillar exceed Caterpillar’s Allocation at such time, (v) all Revolving Credit Advances to CFSC plus the Dollar Amount of all Local Currency Advances and Japan Local Currency Advances exceed CFSC’s Allocation at such time, (vi) any Bank’s Revolving Credit Advances to Caterpillar exceed such Bank’s Allocated Commitment for Caterpillar at such time, or (vii) any Bank’s Revolving Credit Advances to CFSC plus such Bank’s Local Currency Advances and Japan Local Currency Advances at such time exceed such Bank’s Allocated Commitment for CFSC at such time. Each Revolving Credit Borrowing shall be in an aggregate Dollar Amount not less than $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and shall consist of Revolving Credit Advances of the same Type and the same Agreed Currency made on the same day to the same Borrower by the Banks ratably according to their respective Available Revolving Credit Commitments. Within the limits of each Bank’s Allocated Commitment to a Borrower, such Borrower may from time to time borrow, repay pursuant to Section 2.06 or prepay pursuant to Section 2.09, and reborrow under this Section 2.01.
(b)    The Borrowers will on the Closing Date and from time to time thereafter, but no more often than weekly, and subject to the limitation set forth below, allocate or re‑allocate the Total Commitment between Caterpillar and CFSC (each such Borrower’s allocated portion of the Total Commitment at any time being such Borrower’s “Allocation”), in such a manner that (i) the sum of the Allocations at any time shall equal the Total Commitment at such time, (ii) each Bank’s Commitment allocable to Caterpillar and CFSC at any time (such Bank’s “Allocated Commitment” with respect to such Borrower) shall be an amount equal to the product of such Bank’s Commitment at such time multiplied by the Allocation Percentage for such Borrower at such time, and (iii) CFSC’s Allocation at any time shall be in an amount equal to or greater than the sum of the Total Local Currency Commitment and the Total Japan Local Currency Commitment at such time. Each such allocation or re-allocation shall be made on notice, given not later than 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date of the proposed allocation or re-allocation, by the Borrower Agent to the Agent, which shall give to each Bank prompt notice thereof by facsimile or electronic mail. Each such notice of an allocation or re‑allocation of the Total Commitment (a “Notice of Allocation”) shall be by facsimile or electronic mail, confirmed immediately in writing, in substantially the form of Exhibit B-4 hereto, specifying therein the requested (i) effective date of such allocation or re‑allocation of the Total Commitment, and (ii) Allocation for each Borrower. Each Borrower’s Allocation, and each Bank’s Allocated Commitment with respect to such Borrower, shall remain in effect (i) from the Closing Date until the first Notice of Allocation becomes effective, and (ii) thereafter, from the date that the most recent Notice of Allocation became effective until the next subsequent Notice of Allocation becomes effective.
(c)    The Borrowers and the Agent shall furnish to the Local Currency Agent and the Japan Local Currency Agent, promptly following the making, payment or prepayment of each Revolving Credit Advance, and at any other time at the reasonable request of the Local Currency Agent or the Japan Local Currency Agent, a statement setting forth the outstanding Revolving Credit Advances.
SECTION 2.02.     Making the Revolving Credit Advances.
(a)    Each Revolving Credit Borrowing shall be made on notice, given not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date of the proposed Revolving Credit Borrowing (in the case of a Revolving Credit Borrowing comprised of Base Rate Advances), or not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Revolving Credit Borrowing (in the case of a Revolving Credit Borrowing comprised of Eurocurrency Rate Advances), by a Borrower to the Agent, which shall give to each Bank prompt notice thereof by facsimile or electronic mail. Each such notice of a Revolving Credit Borrowing (a “Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing”) shall be by facsimile or electronic mail, confirmed immediately in writing, in substantially the form of Exhibit B-1 hereto, specifying therein the requested (i) Borrower, (ii) date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, (iii) Type of Revolving Credit Advances comprising such Revolving Credit Borrowing, (iv) in the case of a proposed Borrowing of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, Agreed Currency of such Advances, (v) aggregate amount of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, (vi) Interest Period for the Revolving Credit Advances and (vii) account to which the proceeds of such Revolving Credit Borrowing shall be made available. In the case of each proposed Revolving Credit Borrowing, the Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of such Bank’s ratable share of such Revolving Credit Borrowing based upon the Available Revolving Credit Commitments of the Banks, and in the case of a proposed Revolving Credit Borrowing comprised of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, the Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the applicable interest rate under Section 2.07(b). Each Bank shall, before 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent at the applicable Payment Office, in the Agreed Currency and in same day funds, such Bank’s ratable portion of such Revolving Credit Borrowing. After the Agent’s receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, the Agent will promptly make such same day funds available to the account specified by the applicable Borrower in the Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing.
(b)    Each Notice of a Revolving Credit Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower submitting such Notice. In the case of any Revolving Credit Borrowing which the related Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing specifies is to be comprised of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, the requesting Borrower shall indemnify each Bank against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Bank as a direct result of the failure of such Borrower, for any reason other than a default by such Bank, to borrow the requested Revolving Credit Advances on the date specified in the Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing. Such indemnification shall include, without limitation, any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Bank to fund the Advance to be made by such Bank as part of such Borrowing; provided, however, that any indemnification for such losses, costs and expenses shall be limited to an amount equal to (i) the principal amount of the Advance to be made by such Bank times (ii) the number of days in the requested Interest Period, divided by 360 times (iii) the interest differential between the interest rate based on the Eurocurrency Rate which would have applied to such Advance and the rate of interest which would apply if such Borrower had requested on the date of the requested Revolving Credit Borrowing a Revolving Credit Borrowing comprised of Advances of the same Type and Agreed Currency for a period equal to the requested Interest Period. A certificate describing in reasonable detail the amount of such losses, costs and expenses, submitted to such Borrower and the Agent by such Bank, shall create a rebuttable presumption of such losses, costs or expenses.
(c)    Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Bank prior to the time of any Revolving Credit Borrowing that such Bank will not make available to the Agent such Bank’s ratable portion of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Bank has made such portion available to the Agent on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Bank shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Agent, such Bank and such Borrower severally agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to such Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to Revolving Credit Advances comprising such Revolving Credit Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Bank, the Federal Funds Rate. If such Bank shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount, together with interest thereon as required in the immediately preceding sentence, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Bank’s Revolving Credit Advance as part of such Revolving Credit Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement and such Bank shall be entitled to all rights in respect of such Revolving Credit Advance, including the right to receive interest from the date funds in connection therewith shall have been made available to such Borrower. If such Borrower shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount, such repayment shall not relieve such Bank from its obligation to make its ratable portion of such Revolving Credit Borrowing available to such Borrower. Nothing contained herein shall impair the right of such Borrower to the performance by any Bank of such Bank’s obligations hereunder. Subject to Section 2.18, in the event that any Bank shall at any time fail to make its ratable portion of any Revolving Credit Borrowing available to the Agent for disbursement to such Borrower, the Agent shall make inquiry of such Bank as to the circumstances giving rise to such failure and shall promptly advise such Borrower of the response, if any, the Agent shall have received in connection with such inquiry; provided that no failure or delay on the part of the Agent to make such inquiry shall relieve such Borrower or such Bank of its obligation to repay any amount made available by the Agent to such Borrower in anticipation of receiving such Bank’s portion of such Revolving Credit Borrowing.
(d)    The failure of any Bank to make the Revolving Credit Advance to be made by it as part of any Revolving Credit Borrowing shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Revolving Credit Advance on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, but no Bank shall be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make the Revolving Credit Advance to be made by such other Bank on the date of any Revolving Credit Borrowing. Nothing contained herein shall impair the rights and remedies of the Borrower requesting any Revolving Credit Borrowing against any Bank under applicable law as a result of such Bank’s failure to make the Revolving Credit Advance to be made by it as part of such Revolving Credit Borrowing.
(e)    Any Bank may make, carry or transfer Advances at, to or for the account of, any of its branch offices or the office of an Affiliate at the Bank; provided, however, no Affiliate of any Bank shall be deemed a party to this Agreement or shall have any rights, liability or obligation under this Agreement unless such Bank and such Affiliate shall have executed and delivered, and the Agent shall have accepted, an Assignment and Acceptance in accordance with Section 8.07, and then such Affiliate shall have rights and obligations hereunder only to the extent contemplated therein.
(f)    Each Bank shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrowers to such Bank resulting from each Advance made by such Bank from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Bank from time to time hereunder. The Agent shall also maintain accounts in which it will record (a) the amount of each Advance made hereunder, the Type thereof and the Interest Period with respect thereto, (b) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the applicable Borrower to each Bank hereunder and (c) the amount of any sum received by the Agent, the Local Currency Agent or the Japan Local Currency Agent, as applicable, hereunder from the applicable Borrower and each Bank’s share thereof. Entries recorded pursuant to the foregoing shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the Borrowers’ obligations; provided, however, that the failure of the Agent or any Bank to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the applicable Borrower to repay its obligations hereunder in accordance with their terms. Any Bank may request that its Revolving Credit Advances be evidenced by a promissory note in substantially the form of Exhibit A (a “Note”). In such event, the applicable Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Bank such Note payable to the order of such Bank. Thereafter, the Advances evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (prior to any assignment pursuant to Section 8.07) be represented by one or more Notes payable to the order of the payee named therein, except to the extent that any such Bank subsequently returns any such Note for cancellation and requests that such Advances once again be evidenced as described above.

If and to the extent that such Local Currency Bank shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Agent (or, in the case of a Same Day Local Currency Advance, the Local Currency Agent), such Local Currency Bank and CIF severally agree to repay to the Agent (or, in the case of a Same Day Local Currency Advance, the Local Currency Agent) forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to CIF until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent (or, in the case of a Same Day Local Currency Advance, the Local Currency Agent) at (i) in the case of CIF, the interest rate applicable at the time to Local Currency Advances comprising such Local Currency Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Local Currency Bank, the Federal Funds Rate or the Agent’s (or, in the case of a Same Day Local Currency Advance, the Local Currency Agent’s) overdraft cost, if higher.

SECTION 2.05.     Reduction of the Commitments; Bank Additions. (a) Subject to Section 2.18(c), the Borrowers shall have the right, upon at least three (3) Business Days’ notice to the Agent, to terminate in whole or reduce ratably in part the unused portions of the respective Commitments and Allocated Commitments of the Banks; provided that the aggregate amount of the Allocated Commitments of the Banks to (i) Caterpillar shall not be reduced to an amount which is less than the aggregate principal Dollar Amount of the Advances to Caterpillar then outstanding and (ii) CFSC shall not be reduced to an amount which is less than the sum of the aggregate principal Dollar Amount of the Advances to CFSC and the Local Currency Advances and Japan Local Currency Advances then outstanding, and provided, further, that each partial reduction shall be in the aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple thereof. Any such reduction of each Bank’s Commitment will be an automatic reduction of such Bank’s Revolving Credit Commitment in an identical amount.
(b)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the acquisition of one Bank by another Bank, or the merger, consolidation or other combination of any two or more Banks (any such acquisition, merger, consolidation or other combination being referred to hereinafter as a “Combination” and each Bank which is a party to such Combination being hereinafter referred to as a “Combined Bank”), the Borrowers may notify the Agent that they desire to reduce the Commitment of the Bank surviving such Combination (the “Surviving Bank”) to an amount equal to the Commitment of that Combined Bank which had the largest Commitment of each of the Combined Banks party to such Combination (such largest Commitment being the “Surviving Commitment” and the Commitments of the other Combined Banks being hereinafter referred to, collectively, as the “Retired Commitments”). If the Majority Banks (determined as set forth below) and the Agent agree to such reduction in the Surviving Bank’s Commitment, then (i) the aggregate amount of the Commitments shall be reduced by the Retired Commitments effective upon the effective date of the Combination, provided, that, on or before such date the Borrowers have paid in full the outstanding principal amount of the Advances of each of the Combined Banks other than the Combined Bank whose Commitment is the Surviving Commitment, (ii) from and after the effective date of such reduction, the Surviving Bank shall have no obligation with respect to the Retired Commitments, and (iii) the Borrowers shall notify the Agent whether they wish such reduction to be a permanent reduction or a temporary reduction. If such reduction is to be a temporary reduction, then the Borrowers shall be responsible for finding one or more financial institutions (each, a “Replacement Bank”), acceptable to the Agent (such acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), willing to assume the obligations of a Bank hereunder with aggregate Commitments up to the amount of the Retired Commitments. The Agent may require the Replacement Banks to execute such documents, instruments or agreements as the Agent deems necessary or desirable to evidence such Replacement Banks’ agreement to become parties hereunder. For purposes of this Section 2.05(b), Majority Banks shall be determined as if the reduction in the aggregate amount of the Commitments requested by the Borrowers had occurred (i.e., the Combined Banks shall be deemed to have a single Commitment equal to the Surviving Commitment and the aggregate amount of the Commitments shall be deemed to have been reduced by the Retired Commitments).
(c)    The Borrowers shall have the right prior to the Revolving Credit Termination Date, upon at least five (5) Business Days’ notice to the Agent, to add one or more bank or banks as new Banks hereunder, or to increase the Commitment of any existing Bank with such existing Bank’s prior written consent, pursuant to the terms hereof (any such addition of a new Bank or increase in the Commitment of an existing Bank upon the request of the Borrowers pursuant to this Section 2.05(c) being referred to as a “Bank Addition”); provided that (i) such proposed Bank, in the case of a bank not already a Bank hereunder, is acceptable to the Agent (the acceptance of the Agent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii) after giving effect to the proposed Bank Addition, no Bank’s Commitment would exceed 20% of the Total Commitment; and (iii) after giving effect to the proposed Bank Addition, the Total Commitment would not exceed 130% of the Total Commitment on (A) the Closing Date, if such Bank Addition is to occur prior to any Extension Request having been made pursuant to Section 2.16(a) and (B) the date of the most recent Extension Request, if such Bank Addition is to occur after any Extension Request has been made. Each notice of a proposed Bank Addition (a “Notice of Bank Addition”) shall be by facsimile or electronic mail, confirmed immediately in writing, in substantially the form of Exhibit B-5 hereto, specifying therein (i) the name and address of the proposed Added Bank, (ii) the date on which the Borrowers wish such Bank Addition to become effective, and (iii) the amount of the Commitment such Added Bank would have hereunder after giving effect to such Bank Addition. If the conditions set forth in the proviso contained in the first sentence of this Section 2.05(c) have been satisfied, the Agent shall forward to such Added Bank and the Borrowers for execution by such Added Bank and the Borrowers an Assumption and Acceptance. The Added Bank shall, upon such execution, return the executed Assumption and Acceptance to the Agent, for the Agent’s acceptance thereof, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500.
Upon such execution, delivery and acceptance, from and after the effective date specified in each Assumption and Acceptance, the Added Bank shall, in addition to the rights and obligations hereunder held by it immediately prior to such effective date (if any), have the rights and obligations hereunder that have been assumed by it pursuant to such Assumption and Acceptance and, in the case of a bank not previously a Bank hereunder, shall become a Bank hereunder.
By executing and delivering an Assumption and Acceptance, each Added Bank confirms to and agrees with each party hereto as follows: (i) neither the Agent nor any Bank makes any representation or warranty, nor assumes any responsibility with respect to, any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; and (ii) neither the Agent nor any Bank makes any representation or warranty, nor assumes any responsibility with respect to, the financial condition of any Borrower or the performance or observance by any Borrower of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto.
The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in Section 8.02 a copy of each Assumption and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it. Such copies shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers or any Bank at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
Upon its receipt of an Assumption and Acceptance executed by an Added Bank and the Borrowers, the Agent shall, if such Assumption and Acceptance has been completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit C-2 hereto, (i) accept such Assumption and Acceptance, and (ii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrowers. Within five (5) Business Days after receipt of such notice, if requested by an Added Bank, each Borrower, at its own expense, shall execute and deliver to the Agent a new Note or Notes to the order of such Added Bank. Such new Note or Notes shall be dated the effective date of such Assumption and Acceptance and shall otherwise be in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto.
(d)    If there are any Revolving Credit Advances outstanding on the effective date of any Assumption and Acceptance, the Added Bank shall purchase from the other Banks such participations in such Revolving Credit Advances as shall be necessary to cause such Added Bank to share ratably (based on the proportion that such Added Bank’s Revolving Credit Commitment bears to the Total Revolving Credit Commitment after giving effect to the Bank Addition) in each such Revolving Credit Advance. To purchase such participations, the Added Bank shall before 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the effective date of its Assumption and Acceptance, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent at its address referred to in Section 8.02, in the applicable Agreed Currency and in same day funds, such Added Bank’s ratable portion (based on the proportion that such Added Bank’s Revolving Credit Commitment (or the increase in such Added Bank’s Revolving Credit Commitment, in the case of an Added Bank which is an existing Bank hereunder) bears to the Total Revolving Credit Commitment after giving effect to the Bank Addition) of each Revolving Credit Borrowing then outstanding, together with an amount equal to such ratable portion of the interest which has accrued to such date and remains unpaid on such Revolving Credit Borrowing. After the Agent’s receipt of such funds, the Agent will promptly make such same day funds available to the account of each Bank in an amount to such Bank’s ratable portion of such payment by the Added Bank. In addition, if such Added Bank acquires a Local Currency Commitment or a Japan Local Currency Commitment, automatically upon and simultaneously with becoming an Added Bank, such Added Bank shall have acquired a ratable risk participation in all then outstanding Local Currency Advances or Japan Local Currency Advances, as applicable, with such ratable risk participation based on such Added Bank’s Local Currency Commitment or Japan Local Currency Commitment as a fraction of the aggregate of all Local Currency Commitments or Japan Local Currency Commitments, as applicable.
SECTION 2.06.     Repayment of Advances. Each Borrower shall repay the principal amount (or the portion thereof remaining after giving effect to any earlier partial prepayments thereof) of each Advance made to such Borrower by each Bank on the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance.
SECTION 2.07.     Interest on Advances. Each Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Advance made to such Borrower by each Bank from the date of such Advance until such principal amount shall be paid in full, at the following rates per annum:
(a)    Base Rate Advances. If such Advance is a Base Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times during the Interest Period for such Advance to the sum of the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time, payable on the last day of such Interest Period (or, with respect to any portion thereof that shall be prepaid pursuant to Section 2.09 or otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, on the date of such prepayment); or if such Advance is a Japan Base Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times during the Interest Period for such Advance to the sum of the Japan Base Rate in effect from time to time plus the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time, payable on the last day of such Interest Period (or with respect to any portion thereof that shall be prepaid pursuant to Section 2.09 or otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the Japan Local Currency Addendum, on the date of such prepayment).
(b)    Eurocurrency Rate Advances. If such Advance is a Eurocurrency Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times during the Interest Period for such Advance to the sum of the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time, payable on the last day of such Interest Period (or, with respect to any portion thereof that shall be prepaid pursuant to Section 2.09 or otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, on the date of such prepayment) and, if such Interest Period has a duration of more than three months, on the day which occurs during such Interest Period three months from the first day of such Interest Period.
(c)    TIBO Rate Advances. If such Advance is a TIBO Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times during the Interest Period for such Advance to the sum of the TIBO Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time, payable on the last day of such Interest Period (or, with respect to any portion thereof that shall be prepaid pursuant to Section 2.09 or otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, on the date of such prepayment) and, if such Interest Period has a duration of more than three months, on the day which occurs during such Interest Period three months from the first day of such Interest Period.
(d)    Post-Default Interest. Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of any Event of Default, the unpaid principal amount of each Advance shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum otherwise required to be paid on such Advance in accordance with subsection (a), (b) or (c) above; provided that any amount of principal which is not paid when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) shall bear interest, from the date on which such amount is due until such amount is paid in full, payable on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to the greater of (x) 2% per annum above the Base Rate in effect from time to time and (y) 2% per annum above the rate per annum required to be paid on such Advance immediately prior to the date on which such amount became due.
SECTION 2.08.     Interest Rate Determination. The Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrowers and the Banks (or the Local Currency Banks or Japan Local Currency Banks, as applicable) of the applicable interest rate determined by the Agent for purposes of Section 2.07(a) or (b) (or by each Japan Local Currency Bank for the purpose of determining the applicable interest rate under Section 2.07(c), if applicable).
SECTION 2.09.     Prepayments of Advances. (a) Any Borrower may, upon at least two (2) Business Days’ notice to the Agent stating (i) the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment and (ii) the Advances (which shall be part of the same Borrowing) to which such prepayment is to be applied, and if such notice is given such Borrower shall, prepay the outstanding principal amounts of the Advances comprising part of the same Borrowing in whole or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid; provided, however, that (x) each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal Dollar Amount of not less than $10,000,000 and in an integral Dollar Amount multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (y) in the case of any such prepayment of a Eurocurrency Rate Advance or a TIBO Rate Advance, such Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the applicable Banks in respect thereof pursuant to Section 8.04(b).
(b)    If on any date that the Dollar Amount of (i) Eurocurrency Rate Advances outstanding in an Agreed Currency, (ii) Local Currency Advances or (iii) Japan Local Currency Advances, is determined pursuant to Section 2.15 (each such date, a “Computation Date”), it is determined that as a result of currency fluctuations with respect to the Advances to which such Computation Date applies, the aggregate Dollar Amount of (x) all outstanding Advances exceeds the Total Commitment, or (y) all outstanding Revolving Credit Obligations exceeds the Total Revolving Credit Commitment, the Borrowers shall on such date prepay (without premium or penalty other than any payment required pursuant to Section 8.04(b)) an aggregate principal amount of Revolving Credit Advances ratably to the Banks in an amount equal to or, at the option of the Borrowers, greater than such excess, with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid. For purposes of the determination referred to in the previous sentence, if a Disqualifying Event of the type described in clause (ii) of the definition of “Eligible Currency” exists, then such determination shall be made in consultation with Bank of America and JPMorgan using any method they deem reasonably appropriate, and such determination shall be conclusive. The Borrowers may determine which Borrowing such prepayment shall be allocated to, and any such prepayment of Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be subject to the provisions of Section 8.04(b).
SECTION 2.10.     Increased Costs; Capital Adequacy; Illegality. (a) If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change (other than any change by way of imposition or increase of reserve requirements, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, to the extent already included in the Eurocurrency Rate Reserve Percentage) in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to any Bank of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurocurrency Rate Advances or TIBO Rate Advances, then the applicable Borrower shall from time to time, upon written demand by such Bank (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Bank additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Bank for such increased cost; provided, that (x) such Bank shall have certified in writing to the applicable Borrower that it is generally seeking, or intends to generally seek, comparable compensation from similarly situated borrowers under similar credit facilities (to the extent such Bank has the right under such similar credit facilities to do so) with respect to such change regarding such increased cost and (y) such additional amounts shall not be duplicative of any amounts to the extent otherwise paid by the applicable Borrower under any other provision of this Agreement (including, without limitation, any reserve requirements included in determining the Eurocurrency Rate). A certificate describing in reasonable detail the amount of such increased cost, submitted to the Borrowers and the Agent by such Bank, shall create a rebuttable presumption of such increased cost. If any such increase in cost is attributable to specific Advances made to a particular Borrower, compensation for such increased cost shall be paid by such Borrower (or if such Borrower is CIF or CFKK, by CFSC). In all other cases, compensation for such increased cost shall be paid by Caterpillar.
(b)    If any Bank determines that compliance with any law or regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law) affects or would affect the amount of capital or liquidity required or expected to be maintained by such Bank or by any Person controlling such Bank and that the amount of such capital or liquidity requirement is increased by or based upon the existence of such Bank’s Advances or commitment to lend hereunder, then, upon written demand by such Bank (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), the applicable Borrower shall immediately pay to the Agent for the account of such Bank, from time to time as specified by such Bank, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Bank (or, if applicable, such Person controlling such Bank) in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Bank reasonably determines such increase in capital or liquidity requirement to be allocable to the existence of such Bank’s commitment to lend hereunder; provided, that (x) such Bank shall have certified in writing to the applicable Borrower that it is generally seeking, or intends to generally seek, comparable compensation from similarly situated borrowers under similar credit facilities (to the extent such Bank has the right under such similar credit facilities to do so) with respect to such change regarding such increased cost and (y) such additional amounts shall not be duplicative of any amounts to the extent otherwise paid by the applicable Borrower under any other provision of this Agreement (including, without limitation, any reserve requirements included in determining the Eurocurrency Rate). A certificate describing in reasonable detail such amounts submitted to the applicable Borrower by such Bank shall create a rebuttable presumption of such amounts. If any such increase in capital or liquidity requirement is attributable to specific Advances made to a particular Borrower or to the Allocated Commitments to a particular Borrower or Borrowers, compensation for such increase in capital or liquidity requirement shall be paid by such Borrower (or if such Borrower is CIF or CFKK, by CFSC). In all other cases, compensation for such increased capital or liquidity requirement shall be paid by Caterpillar.
(c)    If any Bank shall notify the Agent that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or that any central bank or other Governmental Authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such Bank or its Eurocurrency Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make Local Currency Advances, TIBO Rate Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances or to fund or maintain Local Currency Advances, TIBO Rate Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances hereunder, (i) all Local Currency Advances, TIBO Rate Advances and Eurocurrency Rate Advances of such Bank to any Borrower then outstanding shall be redenominated into Dollars and begin bearing interest at the Base Rate (or in the case of TIBO Rate Advances, be maintained in Japanese Yen but begin bearing interest at the Japan Base Rate) for the Interest Period selected by such Borrower in accordance with the procedures of Section 2.02(a), notwithstanding any prior election by such Borrower to the contrary, either (x) one Business Day after such notice, or (y) if such Bank may lawfully continue to maintain and fund such Advances at the applicable Eurocurrency Rate or TIBO Rate to a later day during such Interest Period, on such later day (in which case such Borrower shall in addition reimburse such Bank for any resulting losses as provided in Section 8.04(b)) and (ii) the obligation of such Bank to make Local Currency Advances, TIBO Rate Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances, as applicable, shall be suspended until such Bank shall notify the Agent that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and until such notification has been given (i) in the case of Local Currency Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances, such Bank shall fund its Local Currency Advance made in connection with each Local Currency Borrowing and Revolving Credit Advance made in connection with each Revolving Credit Borrowing comprised of Eurocurrency Rate Advances as a Base Rate Advance, and (ii) in the case of a Japan Local Currency Advance, the Japan Local Currency Banks shall fund each Japan Local Currency Borrowing with Japan Base Rate Advances.
(d)    If the Majority Banks (or the Majority Local Currency Banks, as applicable) shall, at least one (1) Business Day before the date of any requested Revolving Credit Borrowing or Local Currency Borrowing (or on the date of such Local Currency Borrowing, in the case of a Same Day Local Currency Borrowing), notify the Agent that the Eurocurrency Rate for Eurocurrency Rate Advances comprising such Borrowing will not adequately reflect the cost to such Majority Banks (or such Majority Local Currency Banks, as applicable) of making or funding their respective Eurocurrency Rate Advances for such Revolving Credit Borrowing or Local Currency Borrowing, the Agent shall so notify the Borrowers, and the right of the requesting Borrower to select the Eurocurrency Rate for such Borrowing, and the right of any Borrower to select the Eurocurrency Rate for any subsequent Borrowing, shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrowers and the Banks that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and each Advance comprising such Borrowing shall be a Base Rate Advance.
(e)    If the Majority Japan Local Currency Banks shall, at least one (1) Business Day before the date of any requested Japan Local Currency Borrowing (or on the date of such Borrowing if it is being requested on a same-day basis), notify the Japan Local Currency Agent that the TIBO Rate for TIBO Rate Advances comprising such Borrowing will not adequately reflect the cost to such Majority Japan Local Currency Banks of making or funding their respective TIBO Rate Advances for such Japan Local Currency Borrowing, the Japan Local Currency Agent shall so notify CFKK, and the right of CFKK to select the TIBO Rate for such Borrowing, and the right of CFKK to select the TIBO Rate for any subsequent Borrowing, shall be suspended until the Japan Local Currency Agent shall notify the Borrowers and the Japan Local Currency Banks that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and each Advance comprising such Borrowing shall be a Japan Base Rate Advance.
(f)    In the event that a Bank (an “Affected Bank”) either demands payment from any Borrower at any time pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 2.10 or fails to consent to any extension of the Current Termination Date requested by the Borrowers under Section 2.16, then from such time and for so long thereafter as such Bank remains an Affected Bank, the Borrowers may either (1) terminate such Affected Bank’s Commitment hereunder or (2) replace such Affected Bank with another bank or banks acceptable to the Agent (the consent of the Agent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided that (i) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at such time, (ii) in the case of clause (2), the Affected Bank and the replacement bank(s) execute and deliver to the Agent an Assignment and Acceptance and such other documents, agreements and instruments as the Agent may reasonably require in order to effectuate the assumption by such replacement bank(s) of the Affected Bank’s obligations hereunder, and (iii) the Affected Bank has been paid all amounts due to it hereunder. In no event shall the replacement of an Affected Bank impair or otherwise affect the obligation of the applicable Borrower or Borrowers to make the payments demanded by such Affected Bank pursuant to this Section 2.10 and, if applicable, Section 8.04(b).
(g)    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (x) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith and (y) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives relating to capital adequacy or liquidity promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, shall in each case be deemed to be a change in law and be eligible for redress pursuant to clause (a), (b) and (c), as applicable, of this Section 2.10, regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued.
SECTION 2.11.     Payments and Computations.
(a)    The Borrowers shall make each payment hereunder and under the Notes (except with respect to principal of, interest on, and other amounts relating to Local Currency Advances, Japan Local Currency Advances or Advances denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars), without set-off, deduction, or counterclaim, not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the day when due in Dollars to the Agent in same day funds by deposit of such funds to the Agent’s account maintained at the Payment Office for Dollars in New York City. The Borrowers shall make each payment hereunder and under the Notes with respect to principal of, interest on, and other amounts relating to Advances (other than Local Currency Advances or Japan Local Currency Advances) denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars, without set-off, deduction, or counterclaim, not later than 11:00 A.M. (London time) on the day when due in such Agreed Currency to the Agent in same day funds by deposit of such funds to the Agent’s account maintained at the Payment Office for such Agreed Currency. CIF shall make each payment under the Local Currency Addendum with respect to principal of, interest on, and other amounts relating to Local Currency Advances without set-off, deduction, or counterclaim, not later than 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the day when due in the applicable Local Currency to the Agent (or in the case of a Same Day Local Currency Advance, the Local Currency Agent) in same day funds by deposit of such funds to the Agent’s or the Local Currency Agent’s, as applicable, account maintained at the Payment Office for such Local Currency. CFKK shall make each payment under the Japan Local Currency Addendum with respect to principal of, interest on, and other amounts relating to Japan Local Currency Advances, without set-off, deduction, or counterclaim, not later than 11:00 a.m. (Tokyo time) on the day when due in Japanese Yen to the Japan Local Currency Agent in same day funds by deposit of such funds to the Japan Local Currency Agent’s account at the Payment Office set forth in the Japan Local Currency Addendum. The Agent, the Local Currency Agent or the Japan Local Currency Agent, as applicable, will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest or fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c), 2.05(d), 2.10, 2.12 or 8.04) to the applicable Banks for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Bank to such Bank for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding the foregoing, if an event of the type described in clause (i) of the definition of “Eligible Currency” is continuing, any principal or interest in respect of any Advances made in such currency may be repaid in Dollars.
(b)    All computations of interest based on the Base Rate determined pursuant to clause (a) or (b) of the definition thereof shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be; all computations of interest on Local Currency Advances in Pounds Sterling shall be made by the Local Currency Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be; all computations of interest on Japan Local Currency Advances based on the Japan Base Rate shall be made by the Japan Local Currency Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be; and all computations of interest based on the Eurocurrency Rate (except in the case of Local Currency Advances in Pounds Sterling), the TIBO Rate or the Federal Funds Rate, and all computations of the Commitment Fees shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or Commitment Fees are payable. Each determination by the Agent, the Local Currency Agent or the Japan Local Currency Agent, as the case may be, of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
(c)    Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or Commitment Fees, as the case may be; provided, however, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurocurrency Rate Advances or TIBO Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day and such contraction of time shall in such case reduce the days included in the computation of payment of interest.
(d)    Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank. If and to the extent that such Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent, each Bank shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Bank together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.
SECTION 2.12.     Taxes. (a)    Any and all payments by any of the Borrowers hereunder, under the Local Currency Addendum, under the Japan Local Currency Addendum or under each of the Notes shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.11, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Bank, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent and the Agent, (i) taxes imposed on its net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Bank, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent or the Agent (as the case may be) is organized or any political subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Bank, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction of such Bank’s Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof and (ii) any U.S. federal withholding taxes imposed under FATCA (all such non‑excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as “Taxes”). If any Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder, under the Local Currency Addendum, under the Japan Local Currency Addendum or under any Note to any Bank, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent or the Agent, (i) the sum payable by such Borrower shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.12) such Bank, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent or the Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law.
(b)    In addition, the Borrowers agree to pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder, under the Local Currency Addendum, under the Japan Local Currency Addendum or under the Notes or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum, the Japan Local Currency Addendum or the Notes (hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”). If any such Other Taxes are attributable to a specific Borrower, they shall be paid by such Borrower (or in the case of CFKK or CIF, by CFSC). In all other cases, they shall be paid by Caterpillar.
(c)    Each Borrower will indemnify each Bank, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent and the Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.12) paid by such Bank, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent or the Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Bank, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent or the Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor.
(d)    Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the Borrower paying such Taxes will furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in Section 8.02, a copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof; provided, however, that such copy shall be furnished solely for the purpose of enabling the Agent to verify the payment of such Taxes by such Borrower as required above. If no Taxes are payable in respect of any payment hereunder, under the Local Currency Addendum, under the Japan Local Currency Addendum or under the Notes, the Borrowers will furnish to the Agent, at such address, a certificate from each appropriate taxing authority, or an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Agent, in either case stating that such payment is exempt from or not subject to Taxes; provided, however, that if any Bank, the Agent, the Local Currency Agent or the Japan Local Currency Agent, as a recipient of payments called for hereunder, shall be exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of any Taxes, particularly those imposed by way of withholding, whether by virtue of the provisions of a relevant treaty or otherwise, it shall be incumbent upon such Bank, the Agent, the Local Currency Agent or the Japan Local Currency Agent to (a) so inform the Borrowers, (b) furnish to the Borrowers whatever certification or other documentation may be required by law or regulation to establish such exemption or reduced rate, and (c) cooperate with the Borrowers in any and all other respects to the extent necessary to establish such exemption or eligibility for reduced rate.
(e)    Any Bank whose Advances have resulted in the imposition of Taxes shall use its best efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to take such steps as would eliminate or reduce the amount of such Taxes; provided that no such steps shall be required to be taken if, in the reasonable judgment of such Bank, such steps would be disadvantageous to such Bank.
(f)    Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrowers hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrowers contained in this Section 2.12 shall survive the payment in full of principal and interest hereunder, under the Local Currency Addendum, under the Japan Local Currency Addendum and under the Notes.
(g)    For purposes of determining withholding Taxes imposed under FATCA, from and after the effective date of this Agreement, the Borrowers and the Agent shall treat (and the Banks hereby authorize the Agent to treat) the Advances as not qualifying as a "grandfathered obligation" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1471-2(b)(2)(i).
SECTION 2.13.     Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Bank shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set‑off, or otherwise) on account of the Revolving Credit Advances made by it (other than pursuant to Sections 2.02(c), 2.05(d), 2.10, 2.12 or 8.04) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Revolving Credit Advances obtained by all the Banks, such Bank shall forthwith notify the Agent thereof and purchase from the other Banks such participations in the Revolving Credit Advances made by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Bank to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Bank, such purchase from each Bank shall be rescinded and such Bank shall repay to the purchasing Bank the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Bank’s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Bank’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Bank) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Bank in respect of the total amount so recovered. Each Borrower agrees that any Bank so purchasing a participation from another Bank pursuant to this Section 2.13 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set‑off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Bank were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
SECTION 2.14.     Tax Forms. Each Bank that is not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code), other than any Local Currency Bank or Japan Local Currency Bank that is an Affiliate, branch or agency of a Bank, shall submit to the Borrowers and the Agent, on or before the Closing Date (or in the case of any Person becoming a Bank hereunder pursuant to Section 2.05(c) or Section 8.07, on or before the date of acceptance by the Agent of the applicable Assumption and Acceptance or Assignment and Acceptance), duly completed and signed copies of either Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E (relating to such Bank and entitling it to a complete exemption from withholding on all amounts to be received by such Bank at any Applicable Lending Office designated by such Bank, including fees, under this Agreement) or Form W-8 ECI (relating to all amounts to be received by such Bank at any Applicable Lending Office designated by such Bank, including fees, under this Agreement) of the United States Internal Revenue Service and Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E (relating to the foreign status exemption from United States federal income tax backup withholding), or, in any such case, such successor forms as shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities. Thereafter and from time to time, each such Bank shall, to the extent that it may lawfully do so, submit to the Borrowers and the Agent such additional duly completed and signed copies of one or the other of such forms (or such successor forms as shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities) as may be (i) requested by the Borrowers or the Agent from such Bank and (ii) required under then‑current United States law or regulations to determine the United States withholding taxes on payment in respect of all amounts to be received by such Bank at any Applicable Lending Office designated by such Bank, including fees, under this Agreement. Upon the request of the Borrowers or the Agent, each Bank that is a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall submit to the Borrowers and the Agent a certificate to the effect that it is such a United States person. If any Bank determines that it is unable to submit to the Borrowers and the Agent any form or certificate that such Bank is obligated to submit pursuant to this Section 2.14, or that such Bank is required to withdraw or cancel any such form or certificate previously submitted, such Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent of such fact. In addition, if a payment made to a Bank hereunder, under the Local Currency Addendum, under the Japan Local Currency Addendum or under any of the Notes would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Bank were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Bank shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Agent as may be necessary for the Borrowers and the Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Bank has complied with such Bank’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.14, “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
SECTION 2.15.     Market Disruption; Denomination of Amounts in Dollars.
(a)    Market Disruption. Notwithstanding the satisfaction of all conditions referred to in Article III and this Article II with respect to any Borrowing in any Agreed Currency other than Dollars, if there shall occur on or prior to the date of such Borrowing in any Agreed Currency other than Dollars, any change in national or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates, exchange controls or interest rate quotation sources which would (i) in the reasonable opinion of the Borrowers, the Majority Local Currency Banks (in the case of a Local Currency Borrowing), the Agent or the Banks having at least 66-2/3% of the Available Revolving Credit Commitments, in the case of a Revolving Credit Borrowing, make it impracticable for the Eurocurrency Rate Advances comprising such Borrowing to be denominated in the Agreed Currency specified by the applicable Borrower, then the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to such Borrower, the Local Currency Banks and the Banks, or the applicable Borrower shall give notice to the Agent, the Local Currency Banks and the Banks, as the case may be, and such Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall not be denominated in such currency but shall be made on the date of such Borrowing, in Dollars, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount specified in the related Notice of Borrowing as Base Rate Advances, unless the applicable Borrower notifies the Agent at least one (1) Business Day before such date that (x) it elects not to borrow on such date or (y) it elects to borrow on such date in a different Agreed Currency in which the denomination of such Advances would in the opinion of the Agent, the Majority Local Currency Banks (in the case of a Local Currency Borrowing) or the Banks having at least 66-2/3% of the Available Revolving Credit Commitments, in the case of a Revolving Credit Borrowing, be practicable and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount specified in the related Notice of Borrowing or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of any Bank, make it impracticable for the Eurocurrency Rate Advance of such Bank comprising part of such Borrowing to be denominated in the Agreed Currency specified by the applicable Borrower, then the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to such Borrower, and the Eurocurrency Rate Advance of such Bank as part of such Borrowing shall not be denominated in such currency but shall be made on the date of such Borrowing in Dollars, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount of such Bank’s Advance, as a Base Rate Advance, unless the applicable Borrower notifies the Agent at least one (1) Business Day before such date that (x) it elects not to borrow on such date or (y) it elects to borrow on such date in a different Agreed Currency in which the denomination of all such Advances as part of such Borrowing would in the opinion of the Agent, the Majority Local Currency Banks (in the case of a Local Currency Borrowing) or the Banks having at least 66-2/3% of the Available Revolving Credit Commitments, in the case of a Revolving Credit Borrowing, be practicable and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount specified in the related Notice of Borrowing.
(b)    Calculation of Amounts. Except as set forth below, all amounts referenced in this Article II shall be calculated using the Dollar Amount determined based upon the Equivalent Amount in effect as of the date of any determination thereof; provided, however, that to the extent any Borrower shall be obligated hereunder to pay in Dollars any Borrowing denominated in a currency other than Dollars, such amount shall be paid in Dollars using the Dollar Amount of the Borrowing (calculated based upon the Equivalent Amount in effect on the date of payment thereof). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the full risk of currency fluctuations shall be borne by the Borrowers and the Borrowers agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Local Currency Bank, each Japan Local Currency Bank, the Agent and the Banks from and against any loss resulting from any Borrowing denominated in a currency other than in Dollars.
(c)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum, or the Japan Local Currency Addendum, if the Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the Majority Banks notify the Agent (with a copy to the Borrowers) that the Majority Banks have determined, that:
(i)    adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period, including, without limitation, because the Eurocurrency Base Rate is not available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or
(ii)    the supervisor for the administrator of the Eurocurrency Base Rate or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Agent has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which the Eurocurrency Base Rate shall no longer be made available, or used for determining the interest rate of loans (such specific date, the “Scheduled Unavailability Date”),
then, after such determination by the Agent or receipt by the Agent of such notice, as applicable, the Agent and the Borrowers may amend this Agreement to replace the Eurocurrency Base Rate with an alternate benchmark rate (including any mathematical or other adjustments to the benchmark (if any) incorporated therein) that has been broadly accepted by the syndicated loan market in the United States in lieu of the Eurocurrency Base Rate provided, that, if such alternate benchmark rate as so determined is below zero, it will be deemed to be zero for purposes of this Agreement (any such proposed rate, a “LIBOR Successor Rate”), together with any proposed LIBOR Successor Rate Conforming Changes and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 8.01, any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on the fifth Business Day after the Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Banks and the Borrowers unless, prior to such time, Banks comprising the Majority Banks have delivered to the Agent notice that such Majority Banks do not accept such amendment.
If no LIBOR Successor Rate has been determined and the circumstances under clause (i) above exist, the obligation of the Banks to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be suspended, (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Advances or Interest Periods).  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrowers may revoke any pending request for a Eurocurrency Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Advances (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Advances or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Advances in Dollars in the Equivalent Amount specified therein.
SECTION 2.16.     Extensions of the Commitments.
(a)    During the period from the date that is 60 days prior to the Current Termination Date to the date that is 32 days prior to each anniversary of the Closing Date the Borrowers may, by written notice (an “Extension Request”) given to the Agent, request that the Current Termination Date be extended. Each such Extension Request shall contemplate an extension of the Current Termination Date to a date that is one year after the Current Termination Date then in effect (or if such date is not a Business Day, the immediately preceding Business Day).
(b)    The Agent shall promptly advise each Bank, including each Local Currency Bank and each Japan Local Currency Bank, of its receipt of any Extension Request. Each Bank may, in its sole discretion, consent to a requested extension by giving written notice thereof to the Agent by not later than the Business Day (the “Extension Confirmation Date”) immediately preceding the date that is 31 days after the date of the Extension Request but no more than 45 days prior to the next anniversary of the Closing Date. Failure on the part of any Bank to respond to an Extension Request by the applicable Extension Confirmation Date shall be deemed to be a denial of such request by such Bank. If Banks having at least 50% of the Commitments at the time of the issuance of any Extension Request shall consent in writing to the requested extension, such request shall be granted with respect to each consenting Bank; provided, however, that no such consent shall be granted in connection with (i) Local Currency Advances unless Local Currency Banks having at least 50% of the Local Currency Commitments at the time of issuance of any Extension Request shall consent in writing to the requested extension and (ii) Japan Local Currency Advances unless Japan Local Currency Banks having at least 50% of the Japan Local Currency Commitments at the time of issuance of any Extension Request shall consent in writing to the requested extension. Promptly following the opening of business on the first Business Day following the applicable Extension Confirmation Date, the Agent shall notify the Borrowers in writing as to whether the requested extension has been granted (such written notice being an “Extension Confirmation Notice”) and, if granted, such extension shall become effective upon the issuance of such Extension Confirmation Notice. The Agent shall promptly thereafter provide a copy of such Extension Confirmation Notice to each Bank.
(c)    Each Extension Confirmation Notice shall specify therein the date to which the Current Termination Date is to be extended in respect of each of the consenting Banks, which date shall be one year after the Current Termination Date then in effect (or if such date is not a Business Day, the immediately preceding Business Day) (such date being referred to herein as the “Extended Termination Date”). The Current Termination Date with respect to (i) any Banks which shall have denied such requested extension in writing, or which shall have failed to respond to the applicable Extension Request, and (ii) all Banks, in the event that fewer than the minimum number of Banks specified above shall consent in writing to such Extension Request, shall continue to be the then existing Current Termination Date (the “Earlier Termination Date”). The Current Termination Date with respect to those Banks which shall have consented to the applicable Extension Request, in the event that the requisite number of Banks specified above shall consent in writing to such Extension Request, shall continue to be the Earlier Termination Date until the end of the day immediately preceding the Current Termination Date then in effect at which time the Current Termination Date then in effect shall become the Extended Termination Date provided for in such Extension Confirmation Notice.
(d)    If fewer than all of the Banks agree to any extension of the Current Termination Date that shall have become effective in accordance with this Section 2.16, (i) no Advance made or to be made prior to the Earlier Termination Date shall have an Interest Period which ends after the Earlier Termination Date, (ii) all Advances, Local Currency Advances, if applicable, Japan Local Currency Advances, if applicable, and all other obligations, of the Borrower to the Banks hereunder shall be repaid in full on the Earlier Termination Date (whether from proceeds of Borrowings made on the Earlier Termination Date from the Banks having agreed to such extension or from other sources) and (iii) the Commitment, Local Currency Commitment or Japan Local Currency Commitment, as applicable, of each Bank that shall not have consented to such extension shall terminate on the Earlier Termination Date, and such Bank shall have no further obligation hereunder other than in respect of obligations expressly contemplated herein to survive the termination of this Agreement. Such Bank shall also receive from the applicable Borrower all other amounts owing to it hereunder or in connection herewith on the Earlier Termination Date.  [Reserved].
SECTION 2.17.     Defaulting Banks. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Bank becomes a Defaulting Bank, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Bank is a Defaulting Bank:
(a)    Such Defaulting Bank will not be entitled to any fees accruing during such period pursuant to Section 2.04 (without prejudice to the rights of the Banks other than Defaulting Banks in respect of such fees);
(b)    (i) Any amount paid by the Borrowers or otherwise received by the Agent for the account of a Defaulting Bank under this Agreement other than any amounts representing principal or interest payable to such Defaulting Bank (whether on account of fees, indemnity payments or other amounts not constituting principal or interest) will not be paid or distributed to such Defaulting Bank, but will instead be retained by the Agent in a segregated non-interest bearing account until (subject to Section 2.18(d)) the termination of the Commitments and payment in full of all obligations of the Borrowers hereunder and will be applied by the Agent, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to the making of payments from time to time in the following order of priority: first to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Bank to the Agent under this Agreement, second to the payment of post-default interest and then current interest due and payable to the Non-Defaulting Banks, ratably among them in accordance with the amounts of such interest then due and payable to them, third to the payment of fees then due and payable to the Non-Defaulting Banks hereunder, ratably among them in accordance with the amounts of such fees then due and payable to them, fourth to the ratable payment of other amounts then due and payable to the Non-Defaulting Banks, and fifth after the termination of the Commitments and payment in full of all obligations of the Borrowers hereunder, to pay amounts owing under this Agreement to such Defaulting Bank or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct. (ii) Any amount paid by the Borrowers for the account of a Defaulting Bank representing principal or interest payable to such Defaulting Bank shall be paid to such Defaulting Bank in the same amounts and in the same manner as if such Defaulting Bank were a Non-Defaulting Bank;
(c)    The Borrowers may terminate the unused amount of the Commitment of a Defaulting Bank upon not less than three (3) Business Days’ prior notice to the Agent (which will promptly notify the Banks thereof), and in such event the provisions of Section 2.18(b) will apply to all amounts thereafter paid by the Borrowers for the account of such Defaulting Bank under this Agreement (whether on account of principal, interest, fees, indemnity or other amounts), provided that such termination will not be deemed to be a waiver or release of any claim any Borrower, the Agent or any Bank may have against such Defaulting Bank; and
(d)    In the event that the Borrowers and the Agent agree in writing in their discretion that a Bank is no longer a Defaulting Bank, the Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any amounts then held in the segregated account referred to in Section 2.18(b)), such Bank will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par such portion of outstanding Advances of the other Banks and/or make such other adjustments as the Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Revolving Credit Obligations of the Banks to be on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective Commitments, whereupon such Bank will cease to be a Defaulting Bank and will be a Non-Defaulting Bank (and each Bank’s ratable portion of aggregate outstanding Advances will automatically be adjusted on a prospective basis to reflect the foregoing); provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrowers while such Bank was a Defaulting Bank; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Bank to Non-Defaulting Bank will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Bank’s having been a Defaulting Bank.
SECTION 2.18.     Funding Vehicle. Each Bank may, at its option, make any Borrowing available to either CFKK or CIF by causing any foreign or domestic branch or Affiliate of such Bank to make such Borrowing available; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of such Borrower to repay such Borrowing in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum and the Japan Local Currency Addendum, as applicable.

ARTICLE IV    
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

(d)    Execution; Enforceability.
(i)    This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer of such Borrower. Upon execution of this Agreement by the Agent and when the Agent shall have been notified by each Bank that such Bank has executed this Agreement, this Agreement will be, and such Borrower’s Notes when executed and delivered hereunder will be, legal, valid and binding obligations of such Borrower enforceable against such Borrower in accordance with their respective terms, except as enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or affecting creditors’ rights generally and by the effect of general principles of equity.
(ii)    The Local Currency Addendum has been duly executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer of each of CFSC and CIF. Upon execution of the Local Currency Addendum by the Agent and the Local Currency Agent and when the Local Currency Agent or the Agent shall have been notified by each Local Currency Bank that such Local Currency Bank has executed the Local Currency Addendum, the Local Currency Addendum will be the legal, valid and binding obligation of each of CFSC and CIF enforceable against each of CFSC and CIF in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or affecting creditors’ rights generally and by the effect of general principles of equity.

Upon execution of the Japan Local Currency Addendum by the Agent and the Japan Local Currency Agent and when the Japan Local Currency Agent or the Agent shall have been notified by each Japan Local Currency Bank that such Japan Local Currency Bank has executed the Japan Local Currency Addendum, the Japan Local Currency Addendum will be the legal, valid and binding obligation of each of CFSC and CFKK enforceable against each of CFSC and CFKK in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or affecting creditors’ rights generally and by the effect of general principles of equity.
(e)    Accuracy of Information; Material Adverse Change. The consolidated balance sheets of Caterpillar and CFSC as at December 31, 2018 and as at June 30, 2019, and the related consolidated statements of income and changes in stockholders’ equity of Caterpillar and CFSC for the fiscal year and six‑month period, respectively, then ended, copies of which have been furnished to each Bank, fairly present the financial condition of Caterpillar and CFSC as at such dates and the results of the operations of Caterpillar and CFSC for such periods, all in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied. Since December 31, 2018, there has been no material adverse change in such condition or operations. As of the Closing Date, the information included in the Beneficial Ownership Certification is true and correct in all respects.
(f)    Litigation. There is no pending or threatened action or proceeding affecting such Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator which is reasonably likely to materially adversely affect the financial condition or operations of such Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole or which purports to affect the legality, validity or enforceability of this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum, the Japan Local Currency Addendum or any Note or which is reasonably likely to materially adversely affect the ability of such Borrower to perform its obligations under this Agreement and its Notes or under the Local Currency Addendum, in the case of CIF and CFSC, or under the Japan Local Currency Addendum, in the case of CFKK and CFSC.

Following the application of the proceeds of each Advance, no more than 25% of the value of the assets of such Borrower will consist of, or be represented by, Margin Stock.
(h)    ERISA. Each Plan of such Borrower or a Subsidiary of such Borrower or an ERISA Affiliate complies in all material respects with ERISA, the Code and regulations thereunder and the terms of such Plan, except for such noncompliance as would not reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect on the ability of such Borrower to perform its obligations under this Agreement and its Notes. Each Plan has satisfied the minimum funding standard under Section 412(a) of the Code without the need of any funding waiver under Section 412(c) of the Code. Neither such Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate nor any fiduciary of any Plan which is not a multiemployer plan (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (i) has engaged in a nonexempt prohibited transaction described in Sections 406 of ERISA or 4975 of the Code whereby such prohibited transaction has materially adversely affected the business, financial condition or results of operations of such Borrower and any of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) has taken or failed to take any action which would constitute or result in an ERISA Termination Event. During the six year period prior to the date on which this representation is made or deemed made, neither such Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has (i) failed to make a required contribution or payment to a multiemployer plan or (ii) made a complete or partial withdrawal under Sections 4203 or 4205 of ERISA from a multiemployer plan. During the six year period prior to the date on which this representation is made or deemed made, neither such Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has failed to make a required installment or any other required payment under Section 412 of the Code or Section 430 of the Code on or before the due date for such installment or other payment. Neither such Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability to the PBGC which remains outstanding other than the payment of premiums, and there are no premium payments which have become due which are unpaid. None of the Borrowers nor any of their respective Subsidiaries is an entity deemed to hold “plan assets” (within the meaning of the Plan Asset Regulations), and neither the execution, delivery or performance of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, including the making of any Advance hereunder, will give rise to a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.
(i)    Taxes; Assessments. Such Borrower has paid or discharged, or caused to be paid or discharged, before the same shall have become delinquent, all taxes, assessments and governmental charges levied or imposed upon such Borrower or any Subsidiary of such Borrower or upon the income, profits or property of such Borrower or any Subsidiary of such Borrower, other than (i) such taxes, assessments and governmental charges the amount, applicability or validity of which is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves have been established, or (ii) up to $10,000,000 at any time in aggregate taxes, assessments, and governmental charges so long as no material adverse effect upon the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, would reasonably be expected to result therefrom, and so long as, upon knowledge thereof, the applicable Borrower or Subsidiary either promptly pays the applicable delinquent amount or contests such amount as contemplated above.
(j)    Sanctions Laws and Regulations. Neither any Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the best of such Borrower’s knowledge, any of its or any of its Subsidiaries’ respective directors or officers is a Designated Person. Each of the Borrowers has a “Worldwide Code of Conduct” in full force and effect on the date hereof which, by its terms, applies to all activities undertaken by all Borrowers’ and Subsidiaries’ employees around the world. Among the commitments in the Worldwide Code of Conduct is the commitment that each of the Borrowers and Subsidiaries, and their respective employees, follow applicable import and export control laws when conducting business around the world, including any Anti-Corruption Laws and Sanctions Laws and Regulations, and such commitment currently applies, and will apply, to all activities undertaken by each Borrower and each Subsidiary, including but not limited to, any use of the proceeds of this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum, the Japan Local Currency Addendum or any Advance, as well as the payment of any amount due pursuant to this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum or the Japan Local Currency Addendum.
SECTION 4.02.     Additional Representations and Warranties of CFSC, CIF and CFKK.
Each of CFSC, CIF and CFKK represents and warrants that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries is an “investment company” or a company “controlled” by an “investment company”, within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

COVENANTS OF THE BORROWERS
SECTION 5.01.     Affirmative Covenants.

(a)    Corporate Existence, Etc. Subject to Section 5.02(b), do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence, rights (charter and statutory) and franchises; provided, however, that such Borrower shall not be required to preserve any such right or franchise if its board of directors shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of such Borrower and that the loss thereof would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement and its Notes.
(b)    Compliance with Laws, Etc. Comply, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to comply, in all material respects with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and orders, noncompliance with which would reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect (i) the financial condition or operations of such Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) the ability of such Borrower to perform its obligations under this Agreement, its Notes, and, if applicable, the Local Currency Addendum or the Japan Local Currency Addendum. Each Borrower will maintain in effect and enforce policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance by such Borrower, each of its Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents with Anti-Corruption Laws and applicable Sanctions Laws and Regulations.

Cause all properties used or useful in the conduct of its business or the business of any of its Subsidiaries to be maintained and kept in good condition, repair and working order and supplied with all necessary equipment and will cause to be made all necessary repairs, renewals, replacements, betterments and improvements thereof, all as in the judgment of such Borrower may be necessary so that the business carried on in connection therewith may be properly and advantageously conducted at all times; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall prevent such Borrower from discontinuing the operation or maintenance of any of such properties if such discontinuance is, in the reasonable judgment of such Borrower, desirable in the conduct of its business or the business of any Subsidiary of such Borrower and would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement and its Notes.
(d)    Payment of Taxes and Other Claims.

(e)    Use of Proceeds. Use all proceeds of Advances solely for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, repaying or prepaying Advances in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. No Borrower will request any Borrowing, and no Borrower shall knowingly use, and shall ensure that its Subsidiaries and its or their respective directors, officers, employees and agents shall not knowingly use, the proceeds of any Borrowing (i) in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization of the payment or giving of money, or anything else of value, to any Person in violation of any Anti-Corruption Laws, (ii) for the purpose of funding, financing or facilitating any activities, business or transaction of or with any Sanctioned Person, or in any Sanctioned Country, to the extent such activities, businesses or transactions would be prohibited by Sanctions Laws and Regulations if conducted by a corporation incorporated in the United States or in a European Union member state or (iii) in any manner that would result in the violation of any Sanctions Laws and Regulations applicable to any party hereto.

provided, however, that the filing of one or more of the proceedings and/or the occurrence of one or more of the other events described in this Section 6.01(e) with respect to any Insignificant Subsidiary shall not constitute an Event of Default hereunder until such time as the aggregate of the asset values, as reasonably determined by Caterpillar in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, of all Insignificant Subsidiaries subject to the proceedings and/or other events described in this Section 6.01(e) equals or exceeds $250,000,000 (with each Insignificant Subsidiary’s asset value being determined, for purposes of this clause (e), on the date on which such filing or other event commences or otherwise initially occurs with respect to such Insignificant Subsidiary and with such value remaining in effect for such Insignificant Subsidiary once determined); or

then, and in any such event, (i) the Agent (x) shall at the request, or may with the consent, of the Majority Banks, by notice to the Borrowers, declare the obligation of each Bank to make Advances to such Borrower to be terminated, whereupon the same shall forthwith terminate, and (y) shall at the request, or may with the consent, of the Majority Banks, by notice to such Borrower, declare the Advances to such Borrower, all interest thereon and all other amounts payable under this Agreement to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon such Advances, all such interest and all such amounts shall become and be forthwith due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by such Borrower; (ii) in the case of a CFSC Event of Default or a CIF Event of Default, the Local Currency Agent, (x) shall at the request, or may with the consent, of the Majority Local Currency Banks, by notice to the Borrowers, declare the obligation of each Local Currency Bank to make Local Currency Advances to CIF to be terminated, whereupon the same shall forthwith terminate, and (y) shall at the request, or may with the consent, of the Majority Local Currency Banks, by notice to CIF, declare the Local Currency Advances to CIF, all interest thereon and all other amounts payable under this Agreement and the Local Currency Addendum to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon such Local Currency Advances, all such interest and all such amounts shall become and be forthwith due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by CIF and (iii) in the case of a CFSC Event of Default or a CFKK Event of Default, the Japan Local Currency Agent, (x) shall at the request, or may with the consent, of the Majority Japan Local Currency Banks, by notice to the Borrowers, declare the obligation of each Japan Local Currency Bank to make Japan Local Currency Advances to CFKK to be terminated, whereupon the same shall forthwith terminate, and (y) shall at the request, or may with the consent, of the Majority Japan Local Currency Banks, by notice to CFKK, declare the Japan Local Currency Advances to CFKK, all interest thereon and all other amounts payable under this Agreement and the Japan Local Currency Addendum to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon such Japan Local Currency Advances, all such interest and all such amounts shall become and be forthwith due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by CFKK; provided, however, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to any Borrower described in Section 6.01(e), (A) the obligation of each Bank to make Advances to any Borrower shall automatically be terminated and (B) the Advances to the Borrowers, all such interest and all such amounts shall automatically become and be due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or any notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrowers. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, the fact that an Event of Default exists with respect to one of the Borrowers hereunder shall not of itself constitute an Event of Default with respect to any of the other Borrowers, provided, however, that in the case of CIF and CFKK, any CFSC Event of Default shall be a CIF Event of Default and a CFKK Event of Default.

(b)    Each Bank understands that the Person serving as Agent, acting in its individual capacity, and its Affiliates (collectively, the “Agent’s Group”) are engaged in a wide range of financial services and businesses (including investment management, financing, securities trading, corporate and investment banking and research) (such services and businesses are collectively referred to in this Section 7.02 as “Activities”) and may engage in the Activities with or on behalf of one or more of the Borrowers or their respective Affiliates. Furthermore, the Agent’s Group may, in undertaking the Activities, engage in trading in financial products or undertake other investment businesses for its own account or on behalf of others (including the Borrowers and their Affiliates and including holding, for its own account or on behalf of others, equity, debt and similar positions in the Borrowers or their respective Affiliates), including trading in or holding long, short or derivative positions in securities, loans or other financial products of one or more of the Borrowers or their Affiliates. Each Bank understands and agrees that in engaging in the Activities, the Agent’s Group may receive or otherwise obtain information concerning the Borrowers or their Affiliates (including information concerning the ability of the Borrowers to perform their respective obligations hereunder, under the Local Currency Addendum, if applicable, and under the Japan Local Currency Addendum, if applicable) which information may not be available to any of the Banks that are not members of the Agent’s Group. None of the Agent nor any member of the Agent’s Group shall have any duty to disclose to any Bank or use on behalf of the Banks, and shall not be liable for the failure to so disclose or use, any information whatsoever about or derived from the Activities or otherwise (including any information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any Borrower or any Affiliate of any Borrower) or to account for any revenue or profits obtained in connection with the Activities, except that the Agent shall deliver or otherwise make available to each Bank such documents as are expressly required by this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum or the Japan Local Currency Addendum to be transmitted by the Agent to the Banks.
(c)     Each Bank further understands that there may be situations where members of the Agent’s Group or their respective customers (including the Borrowers and their Affiliates) either now have or may in the future have interests or take actions that may conflict with the interests of any one or more of the Banks (including the interests of the Banks hereunder, under the Local Currency Addendum and under the Japan Local Currency Addendum). Each Bank agrees that no member of the Agent’s Group is or shall be required to restrict its activities as a result of the Person serving as Agent being a member of the Agent’s Group, and that each member of the Agent’s Group may undertake any Activities without further consultation with or notification to any Bank. None of (i) this Agreement, the Notes, the Local Currency Addendum or the Japan Local Currency Addendum, (ii) the receipt by the Agent’s Group of information (including the Information Memorandum) concerning the Borrowers or their Affiliates (including information concerning the ability of the Borrowers to perform their respective obligations hereunder, under the Local Currency Addendum, if applicable, and under the Japan Local Currency Addendum, if applicable) nor (iii) any other matter shall give rise to any fiduciary, equitable or contractual duties (including without limitation any duty of trust or confidence) owing by the Agent or any member of the Agent’s Group to any Bank including any such duty that would prevent or restrict the Agent’s Group from acting on behalf of customers (including the Borrowers or their Affiliates) or for its own account.
SECTION 7.03.     Duties of Agent; Exculpatory Provisions. (a) The Agent’s duties hereunder, the Local Currency Agent’s duties under the Local Currency Addendum and the Japan Local Currency Agent’s duties under the Japan Local Currency Addendum are solely ministerial and administrative in nature and none of the Agent, the Local Currency Agent or the Japan Local Currency Agent shall have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein, in the Local Currency Addendum or in the Japan Local Currency Addendum. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, none of the Agent, the Local Currency Agent or the Japan Local Currency Agent shall have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, but shall be required to act or refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the written direction of the Majority Banks, the Majority Local Currency Banks or the Majority Japan Local Currency Banks, as applicable (or such other number or percentage of the Banks as shall be expressly provided for herein, in the Local Currency Addendum or in the Japan Local Currency Addendum, as applicable), provided that none of the Agent, the Local Currency Agent or the Japan Local Currency Agent shall be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent or any of their respective Affiliates to liability or that is contrary to this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum, the Japan Local Currency Addendum or applicable law (including for the avoidance of doubt, any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Bank in violation of any Debtor Relief Law).
(b)    None of the Agent, the Local Currency Agent or the Japan Local Currency Agent shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Majority Banks, the Majority Local Currency Banks or the Majority Japan Local Currency Banks, as applicable (or as the Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 8.01 and 6.01) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Event of Default or the event or events that give or may give rise to any Event of Default unless and until the Borrowers or any Bank shall have given notice to the Agent describing such Event of Default and such event or events.
(c)    None of the Agent, any member of the Agent’s Group, the Local Currency Agent or the Japan Local Currency Agent shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty, representation or other information made or supplied in or in connection with this Agreement, the Information Memorandum, the Local Currency Addendum or the Japan Local Currency Addendum, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith or the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of the information contained therein, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Event of Default or unmatured Event of Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, the Notes, the Local Currency Addendum, the Japan Local Currency Addendum or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article III or elsewhere herein, other than (but subject to the foregoing clause (ii)) to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Agent.
(d)    Nothing in this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum or the Japan Local Currency Addendum shall require the Agent or any of its Related Parties to carry out any “know your customer” or other checks in relation to any person on behalf of any Bank and each Bank confirms to the Agent that it is solely responsible for any such checks it is required to carry out and that it may not rely on any statement in relation to such checks made by the Agent or any of its Related Parties.
SECTION 7.04.     Reliance by Agent. Each of the Agent, the Local Currency Agent and the Japan Local Currency Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. Each of the Agent, the Local Currency Agent and the Japan Local Currency Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of an Advance that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Bank, a Local Currency Bank or the Japan Local Currency Bank, the Agent, the Local Currency Agent and the Japan Local Currency Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Bank, Local Currency Bank or the Japan Local Currency Bank, as applicable unless an officer of the Agent, the Local Currency Agent or the Japan Local Currency Agent, as applicable, responsible for the transactions contemplated hereby shall have received notice to the contrary from such Bank, Local Currency Bank or Japan Local Currency Bank, as applicable, prior to the making of such Advance, and in the case of a Borrowing, such Bank, Local Currency Bank or such Japan Local Currency Bank, as applicable, shall not have made available to the Agent, the Local Currency Agent or the Japan Local Currency Agent, as applicable, such Bank’s, Local Currency Bank’s or Japan Local Currency Bank’s, as applicable, ratable portion of such Borrowing. The Agent, the Local Currency Agent and the Japan Local Currency Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
SECTION 7.05.     Delegation of Duties. The Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder, under the Local Currency Addendum or under the Japan Local Currency Addendum by or through any one or more sub‑agents appointed by the Agent. The Agent and any such sub‑agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. Each such sub‑agent and the Related Parties of the Agent and each such sub‑agent shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this Article VII and Section 8.04 (as though such sub-agents were the “Agent” hereunder or under the Japan Local Currency Addendum) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto.
SECTION 7.06.     Resignation or Removal of Agent. (a) The Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Banks and the Borrowers. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Majority Banks shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrowers, to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Majority Banks and shall have accepted such appointment within 60 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation (such 60-day period, the “Bank Appointment Period”), then the retiring Agent may on behalf of the Banks, appoint a successor Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above. In addition and without any obligation on the part of the retiring Agent to appoint, on behalf of the Banks, a successor Agent, the retiring Agent may at any time upon or after the end of the Bank Appointment Period notify the Borrowers and the Banks that no qualifying Person has accepted appointment as successor Agent and the effective date of such retiring Agent’s resignation which effective date shall be no earlier than three business days after the date of such notice. Upon the resignation effective date established in such notice and regardless of whether a successor Agent has been appointed and accepted such appointment, the retiring Agent’s resignation shall nonetheless become effective and (i) the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations as Agent hereunder and (ii) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Agent shall instead be made by or to each Bank directly, until such time as the Majority Banks appoint a successor Agent as provided for above in this clause (a).
(b)    If the Person serving as Agent is a Defaulting Bank pursuant to clause (iv) of the definition thereof (such Person, a “Defaulting Agent”), the Majority Banks may, by notice in writing to the Borrowers and such Defaulting Agent, remove such Defaulting Agent as Agent and, in consultation with the Borrowers, appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. Such Defaulting Agent’s removal shall become effective upon the earlier of (x) the date that a qualifying Person shall have been so appointed by the Majority Banks and shall have accepted such appointment and (y) 30 days after the delivery of the removal notice in writing to the Borrowers and such Defaulting Agent (such date, the “Removal Effective Date”). Upon the Removal Effective Date and regardless of whether a successor Agent has been appointed and accepted such appointment, the removal of such Defaulting Agent shall become effective and (i)  such Defaulting Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations as Agent hereunder and (ii) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Agent shall instead be made by or to each Bank directly, until such time as the Majority Banks appoint a successor Agent as provided for above in this clause (b).
(c) Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties as Agent of the retiring (or retired) or removed Agent, and the retiring or removed Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations as Agent hereunder (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section 7.06). The fees payable by the Borrowers to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrowers and such successor. After the retiring or removed Agent’s resignation or removal hereunder, or any retiring Local Currency Agent’s resignation or removal under the Local Currency Addendum, or any retiring Japan Local Currency Agent’s resignation or removal under the Japan Local Currency Addendum, the provisions of this Article VII and Section 8.04 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Agent, Local Currency Agent or Japan Local Currency Agent, its sub‑agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or removed Agent was acting as Agent, the retiring Local Currency Agent was acting as Local Currency Agent or the retiring Japan Local Currency Agent was acting as Japan Local Currency Agent.
SECTION 7.07.     Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Banks. (a) Each Bank confirms to the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, each other Bank and each of their respective Related Parties that it (i) possesses (individually or through its Related Parties) such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that it is capable, without reliance on the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, any other Bank or any of their respective Related Parties, of evaluating the merits and risks (including tax, legal, regulatory, credit, accounting and other financial matters) of (x) entering into this Agreement, (y) making Advances and other extensions of credit hereunder and (z) taking or not taking actions hereunder and thereunder, (ii) is financially able to bear such risks and (iii) has determined that entering into this Agreement and making Advances and other extensions of credit hereunder is suitable and appropriate for it.
(b)    Each Bank acknowledges that (i) it is solely responsible for making its own independent appraisal and investigation of all risks arising under or in connection with this Agreement and, to the extent such Bank is a party thereto, the Local Currency Addendum and the Japan Local Currency Addendum, (ii) that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, any other Bank or any of their respective Related Parties, made its own appraisal and investigation of all risks associated with, and its own credit analysis and decision to enter into, this Agreement and, to the extent such Bank is a party thereto, the Local Currency Addendum and the Japan Local Currency Addendum, based on such documents and information, as it has deemed appropriate and (iii) it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, any other Bank or any of their respective Related Parties, continue to be solely responsible for making its own appraisal and investigation of all risks arising under or in connection with, and its own credit analysis and decision to take or not take action under, this Agreement and, to the extent such Bank is a party thereto, the Local Currency Addendum and the Japan Local Currency Addendum, based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, which may include, in each case:
(A)    the financial condition, status and capitalization of each Borrower;
(B)    the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or enforceability of this Agreement, the Notes (with respect to any Bank that has requested a Note), the Local Currency Addendum (with respect to any Bank party thereto), the Japan Local Currency Addendum (with respect to any Bank party thereto) and any other agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, under or in connection herewith or therewith;
(C)    determining compliance or non-compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of an Advance hereunder and, to the extent such Bank is a party thereto, under the Local Currency Addendum or the Japan Local Currency Addendum, and the form and substance of all evidence delivered in connection with establishing the satisfaction of each such condition subject to confirmation by the Agent of its receipt of items requested to be delivered as conditions to lending pursuant to Sections 3.01 and 3.02 hereof;
(D)    adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of the Information Memorandum and any other information delivered by the Agent, any other Bank or by any of their respective Related Parties under or in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or any other agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, under or in connection herewith or therewith.
SECTION 7.08.     No Other Duties, etc. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Persons acting as Bookrunners or Arrangers listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Agent or as a Bank hereunder.
SECTION 7.09.     Indemnification. To the extent not reimbursed by the Borrowers in accordance with Section 8.4 hereof, the Banks agree to indemnify the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, the Arrangers and the Co-Syndication Agents ratably according to the respective principal amounts of the Revolving Credit Advances, Local Currency Advances or Japan Local Currency Advances, as applicable, then held by each of them (or if no Revolving Credit Advances, Local Currency Advances or Japan Local Currency Advances are at the time outstanding, ratably according to the respective amounts of their Commitments, Local Currency Commitments or Japan Local Currency Commitments, as applicable), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, the Arrangers or the Co-Syndication Agents in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum or the Japan Local Currency Addendum or any action taken or omitted by the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, the Arrangers or the Co-Syndication Agents under this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum or the Japan Local Currency Addendum; provided that no Bank shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Agent’s, the Local Currency Agent’s, the Japan Local Currency Agent’s, the Arrangers’ or the Co-Syndication Agents’ gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Bank agrees to reimburse the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, the Arrangers and the Co-Syndication Agents promptly upon demand for its ratable share (determined as specified in the first sentence of this Section 7.09) of any out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable outside counsel fees) incurred by the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, the Arrangers or the Co-Syndication Agents in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiation, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum or the Japan Local Currency Addendum, to the extent that the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, the Arrangers or the Co-Syndication Agents are not reimbursed for such expenses by the Borrowers.

(e)    Although the Approved Electronic Platform and its primary web portal are secured with generally-applicable security procedures and policies implemented or modified by the Agent from time to time (including, as of the Closing Date, a dual firewall and a User ID/Password Authorization System) and the Approved Electronic Platform is secured through a single-user-per-deal authorization method whereby each user may access the Approved Electronic Platform only on a deal-by-deal basis, each of the Banks and each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the distribution of material through an electronic medium is not necessarily secure and that there are confidentiality and other risks associated with such distribution. In consideration for the convenience and other benefits afforded by such distribution and for the other consideration provided hereunder, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, each of the Banks and each Borrower hereby approves distribution of the Approved Electronic Communications through the Approved Electronic Platform and, subject to subsection (f) below, understands and assumes the risks of such distribution.
(f)    THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM AND THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”. NONE OF THE AGENT NOR ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THE AGENT’S GROUP WARRANTS THE ACCURACY, ADEQUACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS OR THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM AND EACH EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY FOR ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS OR THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM, EXCEPT FOR ERRORS OR OMISSIONS RESULTING FROM AGENT’S OR AGENT GROUP’S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT. NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY THE AGENT PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS OR THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM.
(g)    Each of the Banks and each Borrower agree that the Agent may, but (except as may be required by applicable law) shall not be obligated to, store the Approved Electronic Communications on the Approved Electronic Platform in accordance with the Agent’s generally-applicable document retention procedures and policies.
SECTION 8.03.     No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of any party hereto to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder, under the Local Currency Addendum, under the Japan Local Currency Addendum or under any Note shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.
SECTION 8.04.     Costs, Expenses and Taxes. (a) Caterpillar agrees to pay on written demand all reasonable costs and expenses of the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, each of the Arrangers and each of the Co-Syndication Agents in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification and amendment of this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum, the Japan Local Currency Addendum, the Notes and the other documents to be delivered hereunder, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of counsel for the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, each of the Arrangers and each of the Co-Syndication Agents with respect thereto and with respect to advising the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, each of the Arrangers and each of the Co-Syndication Agents as to their rights and responsibilities under this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum and the Japan Local Currency Addendum. The Borrowers further agree to pay all costs and expenses, if any (including, without limitation, reasonable counsel fees and expenses of the Banks), of the Agent, the Banks, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, each of the Arrangers and each of the Co-Syndication Agents in connection with the enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum, the Japan Local Currency Addendum, the Notes and the other documents to be delivered hereunder. If any such costs or expenses are attributable to a particular Borrower, such costs or expenses shall be paid by such Borrower. In all other cases, such costs or expenses shall be paid by Caterpillar.
(b)    If any payment of principal of any Eurocurrency Rate Advance or a TIBO Rate Advance is made other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance, as a result of a payment pursuant to Section 2.09 or acceleration of the maturity of the Advances pursuant to Section 6.01 or for any other reason, or if the Banks receive payments from an Added Bank in connection with the purchase of a participation in Eurocurrency Rate Advances by such Added Bank pursuant to Section 2.05(d), the applicable Borrower shall, upon demand by any Bank (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Bank any amounts as such Bank shall reasonably determine in good faith to be required to compensate such Bank for any additional losses, costs or expenses which it may reasonably incur as a result of such payment. Such indemnification shall include, without limitation, any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by any Bank to fund or maintain such Advance; provided, however, that any indemnification for such losses, costs and expenses shall be limited to an amount equal to (i) the principal amount of the Advance paid by such Borrower or the amount of the participation purchased by such Added Bank, as the case may be, times (ii) the number of days remaining in the Interest Period applicable to such Advance, divided by 360, times (iii) the interest differential between the interest rate applicable to such Advance and the rate of interest which would apply on an Advance to such Borrower of the same Type requested on the date of such payment by such Borrower for an Interest Period which most nearly approximates the remaining term of the Interest Period applicable to the Advance paid by such Borrower. A certificate describing in reasonable detail the amount of such losses, costs and expenses, and specifying therein the Type of loan in reference to which such Bank shall have made its calculations thereof (the “Reference Investment”), submitted to such Borrower and the Agent by such Bank, shall create a rebuttable presumption of the rate applicable to the Reference Investment identified therein. In making any determination under this Section 8.04(b), each Bank shall use reasonable efforts to minimize the amount payable by such Borrower hereunder to such Bank, provided that such action does not result in any additional cost, loss or expense for such Bank and is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.
(c)    The Borrowers severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless each of the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, each Bank, each Local Currency Bank, each Japan Local Currency Bank, each Arranger and each Co-Syndication Agent and each of their Affiliates, directors, officers and employees from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and disbursements of outside counsel) which may be incurred by or asserted against the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, such Bank, such Local Currency Bank, such Japan Local Currency Bank, such Arranger or such Co-Syndication Agent or any of its or their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, members, partners, agents, or employees in connection with or arising out of the loan documentation or the transactions contemplated hereby, including but not limited to any investigation, litigation, or proceeding (i) related to any transaction or proposed transaction (whether or not consummated) in which any proceeds of any Borrowing are applied or proposed to be applied, directly or indirectly, by such Borrower, whether or not the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, such Bank, such Local Currency Bank, such Japan Local Currency Bank, such Arranger or such Co-Syndication Agent or any such director, officer or employee is a party to such transactions or (ii) related to such Borrower’s entering into this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum or the Japan Local Currency Addendum, or to any actions or omissions of such Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or any of its or their respective officers, members, partners, agents, directors or employees in connection therewith. If any such claims, damages, liabilities and expenses are attributable to a particular Borrower, such indemnity shall be provided by such Borrower. In all other cases, such indemnity shall be provided by Caterpillar. No Borrower shall be required to indemnify any such indemnified Person from or against any portion of such claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (x) arising out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such indemnified Person or (y) that result from the violation in any material respect by such indemnified Person of any law, regulation, ordinance, or judicial or governmental agency order.
(d)    The Borrowers’ obligations under this Section 8.04 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and repayment of all Advances.
SECTION 8.05.     Right of Set-off. Upon (i) the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default with respect to a Borrower and (ii) the making of the request or the granting of the consent specified by Section 6.01 to authorize the Agent to declare the Advances to such Borrower due and payable pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.01, each Bank is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Bank to or for the credit or the account of such Borrower against any and all of the obligations of such Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum, the Japan Local Currency Addendum, and any Note of such Borrower held by such Bank, irrespective of whether or not such Bank shall have made any demand under this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum, the Japan Local Currency Addendum, or such Note and although such obligations may be unmatured. Each Bank agrees to immediately notify such Borrower and the Agent by facsimile or electronic mail after any such set-off and application made by such Bank, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set off and application. The rights of each Bank under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) which such Bank may have. In the event that any Defaulting Bank exercises any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off will be paid over immediately to the Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.18 and, pending such payment, will be segregated by such Defaulting Bank from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Agent and the other Banks and (y) the Defaulting Bank will provide promptly to the Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the obligations owing to such Defaulting Bank as to which it exercised such right of setoff.
SECTION 8.06.     Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be deemed to have become effective as of September 5, 2019 when it shall have been executed by the Borrowers, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, and the Agent and when the Agent shall have been notified by each Bank that such Bank has executed it and thereafter this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrowers, the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, and each Bank and their respective successors and assigns, except that no Borrower shall have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of all the Banks.
SECTION 8.07.     Assignments and Participations.
(a)    (i) Each Bank may, upon not less than one (1) Business Day’s prior notice to the Agent and with the prior written consent of the Agent (which shall not be required in the case of an assignment by a Bank to another Bank or a Bank’s Affiliate), Caterpillar and CFSC (in each case, which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, that each of Caterpillar and CFSC shall be deemed to have consented to any assignment unless such Borrowers shall object thereto by written notice to the Agent within ten (10) Business Days after having received notice thereof; provided, further, that no consent of Caterpillar or CFSC shall be required in connection with any assignment (x) to a Bank or a Bank’s Affiliate or (y) to an Eligible Financial Institution if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) assign to one or more of such Bank’s Affiliates or to one or more other Banks (or to any Affiliate of such Bank) or to one or more banks or other entities all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, Revolving Credit Commitment, its Local Currency Commitment, its Japan Local Currency Commitment, if applicable, the Advances owing to it and any Note or Notes held by it); provided, however, that (A) each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not a varying, percentage of all of the assigning Bank’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, and shall be in an amount not less than the lesser of (x) $5,000,000 and (y) the remaining amount of the assigning Bank’s Commitment (calculated as at the date of such assignment) or outstanding Advances (if such Bank’s Commitment has been terminated), (B) no such assignment shall result in any Bank having a Commitment which is more than 20% of the Total Commitment, (C) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for its acceptance (but not consent), an Assignment and Acceptance, together with any Note or Notes subject to such assignment and, other than in connection with assignments to a Bank’s Affiliate, a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (which fee may be waived by the Agent in its sole discretion), (D) no such assignment shall be made to any Borrower or any of such Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries and (E) no such assignment will be made to any Defaulting Bank or any of its subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Bank hereunder, would be a Defaulting Bank.
(ii)    Upon such execution, delivery and acceptance of any such Assignment and Acceptance, from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the assignee thereunder shall, in addition to the rights and obligations hereunder held by it immediately prior to such effective date (if any), have the rights and obligations hereunder that have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance and (y) the Bank assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum, if applicable, and the Japan Local Currency Addendum, if applicable (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Bank’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum, if applicable, and the Japan Local Currency Addendum, if applicable, such Bank shall cease to be a party hereto and thereto). Notwithstanding any assignment, each assigning Bank shall continue to have the benefits and obligations of a “Bank” under Section 2.12, Section 8.04 and Section 8.14 hereof to the extent of any Commitments or Advances assigned in accordance herewith.
(b)    By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the Bank assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Bank makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum or the Japan Local Currency Addendum or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum, the Japan Local Currency Addendum, or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; and (ii) such assigning Bank makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of any Borrower or the performance or observance by any Borrower of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto.
(c)    The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at its address referred to in Section 8.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Banks, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Advances owing to, each Bank pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be prima facie evidence of such matters, and the Borrowers, the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent and the Banks may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Bank hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers or any Bank at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(d)    Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Bank and an assignee, together with the Notes, if any, subject to such assignment, the Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit C-1 hereto, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, and (ii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrowers. Within five (5) Business Days after its receipt of such notice, each Borrower, at its own expense, shall execute and deliver to the Agent in exchange for any surrendered Note of such Borrower a new Note, if requested, to the order of such assignee and, if the assigning Bank has retained a Commitment hereunder and requested a new Note, a new Note of such Borrower to the order of the assigning Bank. Such new Note or Notes, if requested, shall be dated the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance and shall otherwise be in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto.
(e)    Each Bank may sell participations to one or more banks or other entities in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, Revolving Credit Commitment, Local Currency Commitment, if applicable, Japan Local Currency Commitment, if applicable, the Advances owing to it and the Notes, if any, held by it); provided, however, that (i) such Bank’s obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, its Commitment to the Borrowers hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Bank shall remain solely responsible to the Borrowers, the other Banks and the Agent for the performance of such obligations, (iii) such Bank shall remain the holder of any such Notes for all purposes of this Agreement, and (iv) the Borrowers, the Agent and the other Banks shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Bank sells such a participation shall provide that such Bank shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Bank will not, without the consent of the participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 8.01(a) that affects such participant.
(f)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Bank may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation, rights to payments of principal of and/or interest on the Advances) to secure obligations of such Bank, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or any central bank having jurisdiction over such Bank, without prior notice to or consent of the Borrowers or the Agent; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Bank from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Bank as a party hereto.
SECTION 8.08.     Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Service of Process.
(a)    This Agreement and the Notes shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of New York (without regard for conflict of law principles that would result in the application of any law other than the internal law of the State of New York).
(b)    Each of the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, each Bank, each Local Currency Bank, each Japan Local Currency Bank and each Borrower hereby (i) irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding brought in accordance with Section 8.08(c); and (ii) agrees that a final judgment in any action brought in accordance with Section 8.08(c) or proceeding may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Each Borrower irrevocably consents to the service of process of any of the aforesaid courts in any such action or proceeding by the mailing or delivery of a copy of such process to The Corporation Trust Company, as its agent for the purpose of accepting such process, at Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19801.
(c)    Each Borrower irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction (or, solely in the case of CFKK and CIF, to the non-exclusive jurisdiction) of (A) any New York State or United States federal court sitting in New York City (and any appellate court hearing appeals from any such court), (B) any Illinois State or United States federal court sitting in Chicago, Illinois (and any appellate court hearing appeals from any such court) and (C) any United States federal court sitting in Nashville, Tennessee (and any appellate court hearing appeals from any such court), in each case, in connection with any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding shall be heard (and with respect to CFKK and CIF may be heard) and determined in any such New York State court sitting in New York City or Illinois State court sitting in Chicago, Illinois or, to the extent permitted by law, in such federal court sitting in New York City, Chicago, Illinois or Nashville, Tennessee. Each of the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, each Bank, each Local Currency Bank and each Japan Local Currency Bank hereby submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State or United States federal court sitting in New York City (and any appellate court hearing appeals from any such court).
(d)    Nothing in this Section 8.08 shall affect the right of any Borrower, the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, any Bank, any Local Currency Bank or any Japan Local Currency Bank to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law.
(e)    Nothing in this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum or the Japan Local Currency Addendum shall affect any right that the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, each Bank, each Local Currency Bank and each Japan Local Currency Bank may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum or the Japan Local Currency Addendum against any Borrower or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.
SECTION 8.09.     Caterpillar as Agent for the Borrowers. CFSC, CIF and CFKK hereby appoint Caterpillar as their agent for purposes of giving notice to or otherwise advising the Agent or the Banks in such instances where this Agreement calls for notice or advice from the Borrowers rather than from a specific Borrower (Caterpillar, in such capacity, being referred to herein as the “Borrower Agent”). The Banks and the Agent may assume that any advice given to them by Caterpillar in respect of the Borrowers validly represents the collective decision of the Borrowers, and the Banks and the Agent may rely upon such advice in all instances. Each of CIF and CFKK hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest possible extent, any defense of forum non conveniens.
SECTION 8.10.     Judgment Currency. If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due under this Agreement, under the Local Currency Addendum, under the Japan Local Currency Addendum or under any of the Notes in any currency (the “Original Currency”) into another currency (the “Other Currency”), the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which, in accordance with normal banking procedures, the Agent could purchase the Original Currency with the Other Currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the obligation of any Borrower in respect to any sum due in the Original Currency to the Agent or any Bank shall, notwithstanding any judgment in an Other Currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Agent or such Bank, as applicable, of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Other Currency, the Agent or such Bank, as applicable, may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Original Currency with the Other Currency; if the amount of the Original Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Agent or such Bank, as applicable, in the Original Currency, the applicable Borrower or Borrowers agree, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Agent or such Bank, as applicable, against such loss, and if the amount of the Original Currency so purchased exceeds the sum originally due the Agent or such Bank in the Original Currency, the Agent or such Bank, as applicable, agrees to remit to the applicable Borrower or Borrowers such excess.
SECTION 8.11.     Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. A facsimile or PDF copy of any signature hereto shall have the same effect as the original of such signature.
SECTION 8.12.     Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH BORROWER, THE AGENT, THE LOCAL CURRENCY AGENT, THE JAPAN LOCAL CURRENCY AGENT, EACH BANK, EACH LOCAL CURRENCY BANK AND EACH JAPAN LOCAL CURRENCY BANK IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY DISPUTE, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, AMONG ANY OF THE PARTIES HERETO ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, THE LOCAL CURRENCY ADDENDUM, THE JAPAN LOCAL CURRENCY ADDENDUM, OR ANY NOTE. ANY PARTY HERETO MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY.
SECTION 8.13.     USA Patriot Act Notification. The following notification is provided to the Borrowers pursuant to Section 326 of the USA Patriot Act and is effective for the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent and each of the Banks:
IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT. To help the government of the United States of America fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each Person that opens an account, including any deposit account, treasury management account, loan, other extension of credit, or other financial services product. Accordingly, when any Borrower opens an account, the Agent and the Banks will ask for the Borrower’s name, tax identification number (if applicable), business address, and other information that will allow the Agent and the Banks to identify such Borrower. The Agent and the Banks may also ask to see such Borrower’s legal organizational documents or other identifying documents.
SECTION 8.14.     Confidentiality. Each of the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, each Bank, each Local Currency Bank and each Japan Local Currency Bank agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below) in accordance with its customary procedures, so long as such procedures provide for a reasonable standard of care (with such standard of care being at least the same standard of care as such Person would exercise to maintain the confidentiality of its own confidential information), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates’ respective managers, administrators, trustees, partners, directors, members, officers, employees, agents, advisors and other representatives who are involved in the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise have a need to know (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent required, in the reasonable determination of the disclosing party, by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over it or its Affiliates (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners) including in connection with any pledge or assignment permitted under Section 8.07(f), (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the administration of the facility and the exercise of any remedies hereunder, under the Local Currency Addendum, under the Japan Local Currency Addendum or under any other document related to or executed in connection herewith or therewith or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum, the Japan Local Currency Addendum or any other document related to or executed in connection herewith or therewith or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section (except that such agreement shall not contain the exceptions listed in (i) through (iv) of this clause (f)), to (i) any assignee of or participant in, or any prospective assignee of or participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective party (or its managers, administrators, trustees, partners, members, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and other representatives), surety, reinsurer, guarantor or credit liquidity enhancer (or their advisors) to or in connection with any swap, derivative or other similar transaction under which payments are to be made by reference to this Agreement, the obligations of the Borrowers hereunder or payments hereunder, (iii) to any rating agency when required by it (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), or (iv) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar organization (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (g) with the consent of the Borrowers or (h) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or any other breach of an obligation of confidentiality or (y) becomes available to the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, any Bank, any Local Currency Bank, any Japan Local Currency Bank or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrowers.
For purposes of this Section, “Information” means all information received from the Borrowers or any of their respective Subsidiaries relating to the Borrowers or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, any Bank, any Local Currency Bank and any Japan Local Currency Bank on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrowers or any of their respective Subsidiaries, provided that, in the case of information received from the Borrowers or any of their respective Subsidiaries after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care.

SECTION 8.15.     Treatment of Information.Certain of the Banks may enter into this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum and/or the Japan Local Currency Addendum and take or not take action hereunder or thereunder on the basis of information that does not contain Restricting Information. Other Banks may enter into this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum and/or the Japan Local Currency Addendum and take or not take action hereunder or thereunder on the basis of information that may contain Restricting Information. Each Bank acknowledges that United States federal and state securities laws prohibit any person from purchasing or selling securities on the basis of material, non-public information concerning an issuer of such securities or, subject to certain limited exceptions, from communicating such information to any other Person. Neither the Agent nor any of its Related Parties shall, by making any Communications (including Restricting Information) available to a Bank, by participating in any conversations or other interactions with a Bank or otherwise, make or be deemed to make any statement with regard to or otherwise warrant that any such information or Communication does or does not contain Restricting Information nor shall the Agent or any of its Related Parties be responsible or liable in any way for any decision a Bank may make to limit or to not limit its access to Restricting Information. In particular, none of the Agent nor any of its Related Parties (i) shall have, and the Agent, on behalf of itself and each of its Related Parties, hereby disclaims, any duty to ascertain or inquire as to whether or not a Bank has or has not limited its access to Restricting Information, such Bank’s policies or procedures regarding the safeguarding of material, nonpublic information or such Bank’s compliance with applicable laws related thereto or (ii) shall have, or incur, any liability to any Borrower or Bank or any of their respective Related Parties arising out of or relating to the Agent or any of its Related Parties providing or not providing Restricting Information to any Bank.
(a)    Each Borrower agrees that (i) all Communications it provides to the Agent intended for delivery to the Banks whether by posting to the Approved Electronic Platform or otherwise shall be clearly and conspicuously marked “PUBLIC” if such Communications do not contain Restricting Information which, at a minimum, shall mean that the word “PUBLIC” shall appear prominently on the first page thereof, (ii) by marking Communications “PUBLIC,” each Borrower shall be deemed to have authorized the Agent and the Banks to treat such Communications as either publicly available information or not material information (although, in this latter case, such Communications may contain sensitive business information and, therefore, remain subject to the confidentiality undertakings of Section 8.14) with respect to such Borrower or its securities for purposes of United States Federal and state securities laws, (iii) all Communications marked “PUBLIC” may be delivered to all Banks and may be made available through a portion of the Approved Electronic Platform designated “Public Side Information,” and (iv) the Agent shall be entitled to treat any Communications that are not marked “PUBLIC” as Restricting Information and may post such Communications to a portion of the Approved Electronic Platform not designated “Public Side Information.” Neither the Agent nor any of its Affiliates shall be responsible for any statement or other designation by an Borrower regarding whether a Communication contains or does not contain material non-public information with respect to any of the Borrowers or their securities nor shall the Agent or any of its Affiliates incur any liability to any Borrower, any Bank or any other Person for any action taken by the Agent or any of its Affiliates based upon such statement or designation, including any action as a result of which Restricting Information is provided to a Bank that may decide not to take access to Restricting Information. Nothing in this Section 8.15 shall modify or limit a Bank’s obligations under Section 8.14 with regard to Communications and the maintenance of the confidentiality of or other treatment of Information.
(b)    Each Bank acknowledges that circumstances may arise that require it to refer to Communications that might contain Restricting Information. Accordingly, each Bank agrees that it will nominate at least one designee to receive Communications (including Restricting Information) on its behalf and identify such designee (including such designee’s contact information) on such Bank’s Administrative Questionnaire. Each Bank agrees to notify the Agent from time to time of such Bank’s designee’s e-mail address to which notice of the availability of Restricting Information may be sent by electronic transmission.
(c)    Each Bank acknowledges that Communications delivered hereunder, under the Local Currency Addendum and under the Japan Local Currency Addendum may contain Restricting Information and that such Communications are available to all Banks generally. Each Bank that elects not to take access to Restricting Information does so voluntarily and, by such election, acknowledges and agrees that the Agent and other Banks may have access to Restricting Information that is not available to such electing Bank. None of the Agent nor any Bank with access to Restricting Information shall have any duty to disclose such Restricting Information to such electing Bank or to use such Restricting Information on behalf of such electing Bank, and shall not be liable for the failure to so disclose or use, such Restricting Information.
(d)    The provisions of the foregoing clauses of this Section 8.15 are designed to assist the Agent, the Banks and the Borrowers, in complying with their respective contractual obligations and applicable law in circumstances where certain Banks express a desire not to receive Restricting Information notwithstanding that certain Communications hereunder, under the Local Currency Addendum or under the Japan Local Currency Addendum or other information provided to the Banks hereunder or thereunder may contain Restricting Information. Neither the Agent nor any of its Related Parties warrants or makes any other statement with respect to the adequacy of such provisions to achieve such purpose nor does the Agent or any of its Related Parties warrant or make any other statement to the effect that Borrower’s or Bank’s adherence to such provisions will be sufficient to ensure compliance by such Borrower or Bank with its contractual obligations or its duties under applicable law in respect of Restricting Information and each of the Banks and each Borrower assumes the risks associated therewith.
SECTION 8.16.     Amendment and Restatement; Departing Bank. The Borrowers, the Banks (including, without limitation, each Departing Bank), the Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent and the Local Currency Agent each agree that, upon (i) the execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of the parties hereto and (ii) satisfaction (or waiver by the aforementioned parties) of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.01, the terms and provisions of the Existing Credit Agreement shall be and hereby are amended, superseded and restated in their entirety by the terms and provisions of this Agreement. This Agreement is not intended to and shall not constitute a novation of the Existing Credit Agreement or the Debt created thereunder. The commitment of each Bank that is a party to the Existing Credit Agreement shall, on the Closing Date, automatically be deemed amended and the only commitments shall be those hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, upon the effectiveness hereof: (a) all loans incurred under the Existing Credit Agreement which are outstanding on the Closing Date shall continue as Advances under (and shall be governed by the terms of) this Agreement, (b) all obligations under the Existing Credit Agreement with any Bank or any Affiliate of any Bank which are outstanding on the Closing Date shall continue as obligations under this Agreement, (c) the Agent shall have full power and authority to allocate the Commitments and Revolving Credit Commitments of the Banks as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date such that, immediately after giving effect to such allocations on the Closing Date, each Bank (other than a Departing Bank) shall hold the “Commitment” and the “Revolving Credit Commitment” set forth next to its name on Schedule I hereto and the Banks and each Departing Bank, further agree to make all assignments and/or transfers, and hereby consent to any such assignments and transfers, which may be necessary (including, without limitation, assignments of funded obligations) to effect the allocations described in this clause (c) and (d) each Departing Bank’s Commitments and Revolving Credit Commitments under the Existing Credit Agreement immediately prior to giving effect to this Agreement shall be terminated and no Departing Bank shall be a “Bank” party to this Agreement and each Departing Bank shall no longer have any rights or obligations under this Agreement (other than rights and obligations under those provisions of the Existing Credit Agreement that expressly survive termination thereof, which shall survive).
SECTION 8.17.     No Fiduciary Duty. The Agent, each Bank and their Affiliates (collectively, solely for purposes of this paragraph, the “Banks”), may have economic interests that conflict with those of the Borrowers, their stockholders and/or their affiliates. The Borrowers agree that nothing in the Agreement and the related documents or otherwise will be deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty between any Bank, on the one hand, and the Borrowers, their stockholders or their affiliates, on the other. Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that (i) the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and the related documents (including the exercise of rights and remedies hereunder and thereunder) are arm’s-length commercial transactions between the Banks, on the one hand, and such Borrower, on the other, and (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading thereto, (x) no Bank has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Borrower, its stockholders or its affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (or the exercise of rights or remedies with respect thereto) or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether any Bank has advised, is currently advising or will advise such Borrower, its stockholders or its affiliates on other matters) or any other obligation to such Borrower except the obligations expressly set forth in the Agreement and the related documents and (y) each Bank is acting solely as principal and not as the agent or fiduciary of such Borrower, its management, stockholders, creditors or any other Person. Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that it has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate and that it is responsible for making its own independent judgment with respect to such transactions and the process leading thereto. Each Borrower agrees that it will not claim that any Bank has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Bank, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
SECTION 8.18.     Arrangers. Any Affiliate of an Arranger may provide the services of an Arranger for the transactions contemplated hereunder.
SECTION 8.19.     Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of EEA Financial Institutions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum, the Japan Local Currency Addendum or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto and thereto acknowledges that any liability of any EEA Financial Institution arising under this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum, or the Japan Local Currency Addendum, as applicable, may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of an EEA Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:
(a)    the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by an EEA Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder or thereunder which may be payable to it by any party hereto or thereto that is an EEA Financial Institution; and
(b)    the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:
(i)    a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;
(ii)    a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such EEA Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum or the Japan Local Currency Addendum; or
(iii)    the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of any EEA Resolution Authority.
ARTICLE IX    
CFSC GUARANTY
SECTION 9.01.     The Guaranty. CFSC hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Agent, each Bank and each other holder of any obligations owing by CIF and CFKK under this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum and the Japan Local Currency Addendum, the due and punctual payment (whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise) of the principal of and interest on each Advance to each of CIF and CFKK, and the due and punctual payment of all other amounts payable by CIF and CFKK under this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum and the Japan Local Currency Addendum. Upon failure by either CIF or CFKK to pay punctually any such amount, CFSC shall forthwith on demand pay the amount not so paid at the place, in the manner and with the effect otherwise specified in Article II of this Agreement. CFSC’s obligations under this Article IX shall constitute a continuing guaranty of payment and performance and not merely of collection.
SECTION 9.02.     Guaranty Unconditional. The obligations of CFSC under this Article IX shall be unconditional and absolute and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall not be released, discharged or otherwise affected by:
(i)    any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver or release in respect of any obligation of CIF or CFKK under this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum or the Japan Local Currency Addendum, by operation of law or otherwise, or the exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral security therefor;
(ii)    any modification or amendment of or supplement to this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum, the Japan Local Currency Addendum, or any Note;
(iii)    any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of CIF or CFKK, including the merger of CIF or CFKK, into another entity, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting CIF or its assets, or CFKK or its assets, or any resulting release or discharge of any obligation of CIF or CFKK under this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum or the Japan Local Currency Addendum, as applicable;
(iv)    the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights which CFSC may have at any time against CIF or CFKK, the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, any Bank or any other Person, whether in connection herewith or any unrelated transactions, provided that nothing herein shall prevent the assertion of any such claim by separate suit or compulsory counterclaim;
(v)    any invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against CIF or CFKK for any reason of any provision or all of this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum or the Japan Local Currency Addendum, or any provision of applicable law or regulation purporting to prohibit the payment by CIF or CFKK of the principal of or interest on any Advance or any other amount payable by it under this Agreement; or
(vi)    any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by CIF, CFKK, the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, any Bank or any other Person or any other circumstance whatsoever which might, but for the provisions of this paragraph, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of CFSC’s obligations under this Article IX, of CIF’s obligations under this Agreement or the Local Currency Addendum or of CFKK’s obligations under this Agreement or the Japan Local Currency Addendum.
SECTION 9.03.     Discharge Only Upon Payment In Full; Reinstatement in Certain Circumstances. CFSC’s obligations under this Article IX shall remain in full force and effect until the Commitments are terminated and the principal of and interest on the Advances to CIF and CFKK and all other amounts payable by CFSC, CIF and CFKK under this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum and the Japan Local Currency Addendum shall have been paid in full and shall survive the Current Termination Date and the Extended Termination Date, as applicable. If at any time any payment of the principal of or interest on any Advance to CIF or CFKK or any other amount payable by CIF or CFKK under this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum or the Japan Local Currency Addendum (including a payment exercised through a right of setoff) is rescinded or is or must be otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of CIF or CFKK or otherwise (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent or any Bank, in each case in its discretion), CFSC’s obligations hereunder with respect to such payment shall be reinstated at such time as though such payment had been due but not made at such time.
SECTION 9.04.     Waiver by CFSC. CFSC irrevocably waives acceptance hereof, presentment, demand, protest and any notice not provided for herein, as well as any requirement that at any time any right be exhausted or any action be taken by the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, any Bank or any other Person against CIF or CFKK or any other Person or any collateral security. CFSC waives any benefit of the collateral, if any, which may from time to time secure the Advances to CIF or CFKK or any of CIF’s or CFKK’s other obligations under this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum or the Japan Local Currency Addendum, and authorizes the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, or the Banks to take any action or exercise any remedy with respect thereto which the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, or the Banks in its or their discretion shall determine, without notice to CFSC. In the event the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, or the Banks elect to give notice of any action with respect to any such collateral, ten (10) days’ written notice mailed to CFSC by certified mail at its address set forth in Section 8.02 shall be deemed reasonable notice of any matters contained in such notice.
SECTION 9.05.     Subrogation. Upon making any payment hereunder, CFSC shall be subrogated to the rights of the Banks against CIF or CFKK, as applicable, with respect to such payment; provided that CFSC shall not enforce any right or demand or receive any payment by way of subrogation until all amounts of principal of and interest on the Advances to CIF and CFKK and all other amounts payable by CIF and CFKK under this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum and the Japan Local Currency Addendum have been paid in full.
SECTION 9.06.     Stay of Acceleration. In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by CIF or CFKK under this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum or the Japan Local Currency Addendum is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of CIF or CFKK, as applicable, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of this Agreement shall nonetheless be payable by CFSC hereunder forthwith on demand by the Agent for the account of the Banks.

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, [Caterpillar Inc./Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation] (the “Borrower”), HEREBY PROMISES TO PAY to the order of _________________________________________________________________

_________________________________________________________________

________________________________ (the “Bank”) for the account of its Applicable Lending Office (as defined in the Credit Agreement referred to below) the principal amount of each Advance (as defined below) made by the Bank to the Borrower pursuant to the Credit Agreement (as defined below) on the last day of the Interest Period (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for such Advance.
The Borrower promises to pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Advance from the date of such Advance until such principal amount is paid in full, at such interest rates, and payable at such times, as are specified in the Credit Agreement.
Both principal and interest are payable in the currency and to the office of the Agent specified pursuant to the Credit Agreement, in same day funds. Each Advance made by the Bank to the Borrower and the maturity thereof, and all payments made on account of principal thereof, shall be recorded by the Bank and, prior to any transfer hereof, endorsed on the grid attached hereto which is part of this Promissory Note.
This Promissory Note is one of the Notes referred to in, and is entitled to the benefits of, the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (Three-Year Facility) dated as of September 5, 2019, as the same may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time (the “Credit Agreement”) among the Borrower, [names of the other Borrowers under the Credit Agreement] (together with the Borrower, the “Borrowers”), the Bank and certain other banks parties thereto, Citibank Europe plc, UK Branch, as Local Currency Agent, MUFG Bank, Ltd., as Japan Local Currency Agent, and Citibank, N.A., as Agent for the Bank and such other banks. The Credit Agreement, among other things, (i) provides for the making of advances (the “Advances”) by the Bank to the Borrowers from time to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time such Bank’s Commitment (as defined in the Credit Agreement) at such time (the indebtedness of the Borrower resulting from each such Advance to the Borrower being evidenced by this Promissory Note), and (ii) contains provisions for acceleration of the maturity hereof upon the happening of certain stated events and also for prepayments on account of principal hereof prior to the maturity hereof upon the terms and conditions therein specified.
The Borrower hereby waives presentment, demand, protest and notice of any kind. No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any rights hereunder on the part of the holder hereof shall operate as a waiver of such rights.
This Promissory Note shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, United States (without regard for conflict of law principles that would result in the application of any law other than the internal law of the State of New York).

FORM OF OPINION OF COUNSEL
FOR EACH OF CATERPILLAR AND CFSC
[Closing Date]


To the Banks listed on Schedule I hereto
and to Citibank, N.A., as Agent[, Citibank
Europe plc, UK Branch, as Local Currency Agent,
and MUFG Bank, Ltd.,
as Japan Local Currency Agent]

Re: [Name of Applicable Borrower]

Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am in-house counsel for [Name of Applicable Borrower], a Delaware corporation (the “Borrower”), and give this opinion pursuant to Section 3.01(d) of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (Three-Year Facility) dated as of September 5, 2019 (the “Credit Agreement”), among the Borrower, [Caterpillar Inc./Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation], Caterpillar International Finance Designated Activity Company, Caterpillar Finance Kabushiki Kaisha, the Banks parties thereto, Citibank Europe plc, UK Branch, as Local Currency Agent, MUFG Bank, Ltd., as Japan Local Currency Agent, and Citibank, N.A., as Agent for said Banks. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined.
I have examined the Credit Agreement; [the Local Currency Addendum; the Japan Local Currency Addendum;] the documents furnished by the Borrower pursuant to Article III of the Credit Agreement; the [[Restated] Certificate of Incorporation] of the Borrower and any amendments thereto, as currently in effect (the “Charter”); and the [bylaws] of the Borrower and any amendments thereto, as currently in effect (the “Bylaws”). In addition, I have examined the originals, or copies certified to my satisfaction, of such other corporate records of the Borrower, certificates of public officials, and agreements, instruments and other documents, and have conducted such other investigations of fact and law, as I have deemed necessary or advisable for purposes of this opinion letter.
In rendering my opinion, I have assumed the due authorization, execution and delivery of each document referred to herein by all parties to such document other than the Borrower.
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the comments and qualifications set forth below, it is my opinion that:
1.    The Borrower is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each of the jurisdictions listed in Schedule II to this opinion letter.
2.    The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement [, the Local Currency Addendum, the Japan Local Currency Addendum] and the Notes to be executed by it are within the Borrower’s corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not contravene, or constitute a default under (i) the Charter or the Bylaws or (ii) in any material respect, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or any United States Federal or [New York State][Tennessee] law, rule or regulation applicable to the Borrower (I express no opinion relating to the United States federal securities laws or any state securities or Blue Sky laws), (iii) any agreement filed as an exhibit to the Borrower’s annual report on Form 10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) on February 14, 2019, or any agreement filed or incorporated by reference as an exhibit to a filing of the Borrower under Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with the Commission from February 14, 2019 up to and including the date hereof, or (iv) any material judgment, injunction order or decree binding upon the Borrower.
3.    No authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body of the United States[,][or] the State of Delaware [or the State of New York] that in my experience would normally be applicable to general business entities is required for the execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement [, the Local Currency Addendum, the Japan Local Currency Addendum] and the Notes to be executed by it (but I express no opinion relating to any state securities or Blue Sky laws).
4.    The Credit Agreement [, the Local Currency Addendum, the Japan Local Currency Addendum] and its Notes have been duly executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer of the Borrower. Assuming that the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, and each Bank party to the Credit Agreement as of the date hereof have duly executed and delivered the Credit Agreement and that each such Bank has notified the Agent that such Bank has executed the Credit Agreement, [, and assuming that (x) the Local Currency Agent and each Local Currency Bank party to the Local Currency Addendum as of the date hereof have duly executed and delivered the Local Currency Addendum and that each such Local Currency Bank has notified the Agent that such Local Currency Bank has executed the Local Currency Addendum and (y) the Japan Local Currency Agent and each Japan Local Currency Bank party to the Japan Local Currency Addendum as of the date hereof have duly executed and delivered the Japan Local Currency Addendum and that each such Japan Local Currency Bank has notified the Agent that such Japan Local Currency Bank has executed the Japan Local Currency Addendum] the Credit Agreement is, [the Local Currency Addendum is, the Japan Local Currency Addendum is,] the Notes executed and delivered by the Borrower on or prior to the date hereof are, and any other Notes when executed and delivered by the Borrower pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement will be, the valid and binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their respective terms.
5.    There is no pending or, to my actual knowledge, threatened action or proceeding affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator, which purports to affect the legality, validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement [, the Local Currency Addendum, the Japan Local Currency Addendum,] or any Note or which is reasonably likely to materially adversely affect (i) the financial condition or operations of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) the ability of the Borrower to perform its obligations under the Credit Agreement [, the Local Currency Addendum, the Japan Local Currency Addendum] and the Notes to be executed by it.
Insofar as the foregoing opinions relate to the valid existence and good standing of the Borrower, they are based solely on the certificates from public officials attached hereto as Exhibit A. Insofar as the foregoing opinions relate to the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any agreement or obligation of the Borrower, such opinions are subject to (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and to general principles of equity and (ii) limitations under applicable law or public policy on waivers of rights or defenses.
I express no opinion as to (i) Sections 2.13 and 8.05 of the Credit Agreement, insofar as they provide that any Bank purchasing a participation from another Bank pursuant thereto may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such participation or that any Affiliate of a Bank may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such Bank’s claims under the Credit Agreement or the Notes; (ii) Section 2.12(c), 7.09 or 8.04(c), to the extent that any such section may be construed as requiring indemnification with respect to a claim, damage, liability or expense incurred as a result of any violation of law by a Bank[,][or] the Agent [the Local Currency Agent or the Japan Local Currency Agent]; (iii) Section 8.08(c) of the Credit Agreement [or any comparable provisions of the Japan Local Currency Addendum or the Local Currency Addendum], insofar as [any] such provision relates to the subject matter jurisdiction of the United States District Court to adjudicate any controversy related to the Credit Agreement; or (iv) Sections 8.10 or 8.12, [or ]the last sentence of Section 8.08(b) of the Credit Agreement[or any comparable provisions of the Japan Local Currency Addendum or the Local Currency Addendum] or (v) clauses (B) and (C) of Section 8.08(c) of the Credit Agreement, insofar as either such clause relates to the submission to jurisdiction in any Illinois State or United States federal court sitting in Chicago, Illinois (and any appellate court hearing appeals from any such court) or any United States federal court sitting in Nashville, Tennessee (and any appellate court hearing appeals from any such court), as applicable.
For the purposes of my opinion above as it pertains to the enforceability of the provisions contained in Section 8.08 of the Credit Agreement (and any similar provisions contained in the Local Currency Addendum or the Japanese Local Currency Addendum) pursuant to which the parties thereto agree that the laws of the State of New York shall govern such documents, I have assumed that the parties did not enter into any of the agreements described herein with knowledge or deliberate ignorance of the illegality of such document in its place of performance.
[For Cat Financial:][I am qualified to practice law in the State of Tennessee and do not purport to be an expert on, or to express any opinion concerning, any laws other than the law of the State of Tennessee, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal law of the United States. Insofar as the opinions expressed in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 above relate to matters which are governed by the laws of the State of New York, I have assumed for purposes of rendering such opinions that the applicable laws of the State of New York are substantially identical to the laws of the State of Tennessee.]
[For Caterpillar Inc.:] [In rendering the opinion in numbered paragraph 2, I have assumed that to the extent any document referred to in clause (iii) of numbered paragraph 2 is governed by the law of a jurisdiction other than those referred to in the following paragraph, such document would be interpreted in accordance with its plain meaning.]
[The foregoing opinions are limited to the federal law of the United States of America, the law of the State of [New York][Tennessee] and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.]
This opinion letter is limited to the matters expressly set forth herein, and no opinion is implied or may be inferred beyond the matters expressly set forth herein. The opinions expressed herein are being delivered to you as of the date hereof in connection with the transactions described hereinabove and are solely for your benefit in connection with the transactions described hereinabove and may not be relied on, used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to in any manner or for any purpose by any other Person, nor any copies published, communicated or otherwise made available in whole or in part to any other Person without my specific prior written consent, except that (A) you may furnish copies hereof, (i) to your independent auditors and attorneys, (ii) upon the request of any state or federal authority or official having regulatory jurisdiction over you, (iii) pursuant to order or legal process of any court or governmental agency and (iv) to any of your permitted or prospective assigns and/or participants in respect of the Credit Agreement, the Japan Local Currency Addendum and the Local Currency Addendum and (B) assignees that become Banks party to the Credit Agreement pursuant to Section 8.07 thereof may rely on this opinion as if addressed to them on the date hereof, on the condition and understanding that (i) this opinion letter speaks only as of the date hereof as described below and (ii) any such reliance by a future assignee must be actual and reasonable under the circumstances existing at the time such person becomes an assignee, including any changes in law, facts or any other developments known to or reasonably knowable by such person at such time. I assume no obligation to advise you or any other person, or to make any investigations, as to any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof that might affect the opinions expressed herein.
Very truly yours,

SECTION 5.01 Appointment; Nature of Relationship.

SECTION 5.03 General Immunity. Neither the Japan Local Currency Agent nor any of its respective directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable to any of the Borrowers or any Bank for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder or under the Credit Agreement or in connection herewith or therewith except to the extent such action or inaction is found in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Person.
SECTION 5.04 No Responsibility for Advances, Creditworthiness, Collateral, Recitals, Etc. [Intentionally Omitted. See Sections 7.03 and 7.04 of the Credit Agreement for these provisions.]

The Japan Local Currency Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action hereunder and under the Credit Agreement unless it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Japan Local Currency Banks pro rata against any and all liability, cost and expense that it may incur by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.
SECTION 5.06 Employment of Agents and Counsel. The Japan Local Currency Agent may execute any of its duties hereunder and under the Credit Agreement by or through employees, agents, and attorneys-in-fact, and shall not be answerable to the Banks or the Japan Local Currency Banks, except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized agents, for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.

SECTION 5.09 Bank Credit Decision. [Intentionally Omitted. See Section 7.07 of the Credit Agreement for these provisions.]
SECTION 5.10 Successor Japan Local Currency Agent. The Japan Local Currency Agent (i) may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Agent, the Japan Local Currency Banks and the Borrowers, and may appoint one of its Affiliates as successor Japan Local Currency Agent and (ii) may be removed at any time with or without cause by the Majority Japan Local Currency Banks. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Majority Japan Local Currency Banks, with the consent of the Agent, shall have the right to appoint (unless, in the case of the resignation of the Japan Local Currency Agent, the resigning Japan Local Currency Agent has appointed one of its Affiliates as successor Japan Local Currency Agent), on behalf of the Borrowers and the Japan Local Currency Banks, a successor Japan Local Currency Agent. If no successor Japan Local Currency Agent shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty days after the retiring Japan Local Currency Agent’s giving notice of resignation or the Majority Japan Local Currency Banks’ removal of the retiring Japan Local Currency Agent, then the retiring Japan Local Currency Agent may appoint, on behalf of the Borrowers and the Japan Local Currency Banks, a successor Japan Local Currency Agent, which need not be one of its Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, so long as no Event of Default, or event which would constitute an Event of Default but for the requirement that notice be given, time elapse or both, has occurred and is continuing, each such successor Japan Local Currency Agent shall be subject to written approval by CFSC and CFKK, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Such successor Japan Local Currency Agent shall be a commercial bank having capital and retained earnings of at least $500,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Japan Local Currency Agent hereunder by a successor Japan Local Currency Agent, such successor Japan Local Currency Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Japan Local Currency Agent, and the retiring Japan Local Currency Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the Credit Agreement. After any retiring Japan Local Currency Agent’s resignation hereunder as Japan Local Currency Agent, the provisions of this Article V shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Japan Local Currency Agent hereunder and under the Credit Agreement.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Addendum to be duly executed as a deed by their duly authorized officers, all as of the date and year first above written.
