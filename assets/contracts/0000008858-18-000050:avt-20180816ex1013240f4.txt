ARTICLE I
PURCHASE ARRANGEMENTS
Section 1.1      Purchase Facility.  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, Seller may, at its option, sell and assign Purchaser Interests to the Agent for the benefit of one or more of the Purchasers.  During the period from the Initial Closing Date to but not including the Facility Termination Date, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Company may, at its option, instruct the Agent to purchase on behalf of such Company, or if any Company shall decline to purchase, the Agent shall purchase, on behalf  
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED
RECEIVABLES PURCHASE AGREEMENT
  of such declining Company’s Related Financial Institutions, Purchaser Interests from time to time in an aggregate amount for all Purchasers not to exceed at such time the lesser of (i) the Purchase Limit and (ii) the aggregate amount of the Commitments.
Section 1.2       Increases.  Seller shall provide the Agent and each Purchaser (based solely on contact information provided by the Agent), by 1:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the date of each Incremental Purchase, with prior written notice in a form set forth as Exhibit II hereto of such Incremental Purchase (a “Purchase Notice”).  Each Purchase Notice shall be subject to Section 6.2 hereof and, except as set forth below, shall be irrevocable and shall specify the requested Purchase Price (which shall not be less than the lesser of (i) $10,000,000 and (ii) the unused portion of the Purchase Limit on the applicable purchase date) and date of purchase and, in the case of an Incremental Purchase to be funded by any of the Financial Institutions, the requested Discount Rate.  Following its receipt of a Purchase Notice, the Agent will notify each Company of such Purchase Notice no later than 2:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the date of such Incremental Purchase and the Agent will identify the Companies that agree to make the purchase.  If any Company declines to make a proposed Incremental Purchase, Seller may cancel the Purchase Notice as to all Purchasers or, in the absence of such a cancellation, the Incremental Purchase of the Purchaser Interests that such Company has declined to purchase will be made by such declining Company’s Related Financial Institutions in accordance with the rest of this Section 1.2.  If the proposed Incremental Purchase or any portion thereof is to be made by any of the Financial Institutions, the Agent shall send notice of the proposed Incremental Purchase to the applicable Financial Institutions concurrently by telecopier or other electronic transmission specifying (i) the date of such Incremental Purchase, (ii) each Financial Institution’s Pro Rata Share of the aggregate Purchase Price of the Purchaser Interests the Financial Institutions in such Financial Institution’s Purchaser Group are then purchasing and (iii) the requested Discount Rate.  On the date of each Incremental Purchase, upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Article VI and the conditions set forth in this Section 1.2, the Companies and/or the Financial Institutions, as applicable, shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, to the Agent Account, in immediately available funds, no later than 3:00 p.m. (Eastern time), an amount equal to (i) in the case of a Company that has agreed to make such Incremental Purchase, such Company’s Pro Rata Share of the aggregate Purchase Price of the Purchaser Interests of such Incremental Purchase or (ii) in the case of a Financial Institution, such Financial Institution’s Pro Rata Share of the aggregate Purchase Price of the Purchaser Interests the Financial Institutions in such Financial Institution’s Purchaser Group are then purchasing.  The Agent shall deposit the amounts received in the Agent Account pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence into an account designated by the Seller (which may be designated by standing instructions) by no later than 4:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the date of such Incremental Purchase.  The Agent and each Purchaser acknowledge that Seller may designate an account of Originator for the deposit of any such Incremental Purchase for the purpose of satisfying Seller’s purchase price obligations under the Receiavables Sale Agreement.  Each Financial Institution’s Commitment hereunder shall be limited to purchasing Purchaser Interests that the Company in such Financial Institution’s Purchaser Group has declined to purchase.  Each Financial Institution’s obligation shall be several, such that the failure of any Financial Institution to make available to Seller any funds in connection with any purchase shall not relieve any other Financial Institution of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make funds available on the date of such purchase, but no Financial Institution shall be responsible for the failure of any other Financial Institution to make funds available in connection with any purchase.  If any Purchaser shall not remit the full amount that it is required to make available to Agent in immediately available funds as and when required hereunder and if Agent has made available to Seller such amount, then each such Purchaser shall be obligated to immediately remit such amount to Agent, together with interest at the Alternative Base Rate plus 2.00% for each day until the date on which such amount is so remitted.  A notice submitted by Agent to any Purchaser with respect to amounts owing under this Section 1.2 shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
Section 1.3       Decreases.  Seller shall provide the Agent and each Purchaser with written notice (a “Reduction Notice”)  of any proposed reduction of Aggregate Capital from Collections by no later than 1:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the date on which any such proposed reduction of Aggregate Capital from Collections is to occur, and the Agent will promptly notify each Purchaser of such Reduction Notice after the Agent’s receipt thereof.  Such Reduction Notice shall designate (i) the date (the “Proposed Reduction Date”) upon which any such reduction of Aggregate Capital shall occur, and (ii) the amount of Aggregate Capital to be reduced which shall be applied ratably to the Purchaser Interests of the Companies and the Financial Institutions in accordance with the amount of Capital (if any) owing to the Companies (ratably, based on their respective Pro Rata Shares), on the one hand, and the amount of Capital (if any) owing to the Financial Institutions (ratably to each Financial Institution, based on the ratio of such Financial Institution’s Capital at such time to the aggregate Capital of all of the Financial Institutions at such time),
Page 2

RECEIVABLES PURCHASE AGREEMENT
  on the other hand (the “Aggregate Reduction”).  Only one Reduction Notice shall be outstanding at any time.  Concurrently with any reduction of Aggregate Capital pursuant to this Section, Seller shall pay to the applicable Purchaser all Broken Funding Costs arising as a result of such reduction.  No Aggregate Reduction will be made following the occurrence of the Amortization Date without the consent of the Agent.
Section 1.4        Payment Requirements.  All amounts to be paid or deposited by any Seller Party pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be paid or deposited in accordance with the terms hereof no later than 1:00 pm (Eastern time) on the day when due in immediately available funds, and if not received before 1:00 (Eastern  time) shall be deemed to be received on the next succeeding Business Day.  If such amounts are payable to a Purchaser, they shall be paid to the Agent, for the account of such Purchaser, to an account designated by the Agent with notice to the Seller, and the Agent agrees to remit any such amounts received to the applicable Purchaser.  If such amounts are payable to the Agent, they shall be paid to the Agent to an account designated by the Agent with notice to the Seller.  All computations of Yield, per annum fees or CP Costs, per annum fees hereunder and per annum fees under the Fee Letters shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days elapsed.  If any amount hereunder or under any other Transaction Document shall be payable on a day which is not a Business Day, such amount shall be payable on the next succeeding Business Day.
ARTICLE II
PAYMENTS AND COLLECTIONS
Section 2.1        Payments.  Notwithstanding any limitation on recourse contained in this Agreement, Seller shall immediately pay to the Agent or relevant Purchaser, as applicable, when due, for the account of the Agent or the relevant Purchaser or Purchasers on a full recourse basis, (i) such fees as set forth in the Fee Letters (which fees collectively shall be sufficient to pay all fees owing to the Financial Institutions), (ii) all CP Costs, (iii) all amounts payable as Yield, (iv) all amounts payable as Deemed Collections (which shall be immediately due and payable by Seller and applied to reduce outstanding Aggregate Capital hereunder in accordance with Sections 2.2 and 2.3 hereof), (v) all amounts required pursuant to Section 2.6,  (vi) all amounts payable pursuant to Article X, if any, (vii) all Servicer costs and expenses, including the Servicing Fee, in connection with servicing, administering and collecting the Receivables, (viii) all Broken Funding Costs and (ix) all Default Fees (collectively, the “Obligations”).  If any Person fails to pay any of the Obligations when due, such Person agrees to pay, on demand, the Default Fee in respect thereof until paid.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Agreement or the Fee Letters shall require the payment or permit the collection of any amounts hereunder in excess of the maximum permitted by applicable law.  If at any time Seller receives any Collections or is deemed to receive any Collections, Seller shall immediately pay such Collections or Deemed Collections to the Servicer for application in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof and, at all times prior to such payment, such Collections or Deemed Collections shall be held in trust by Seller for the exclusive benefit of the Purchasers and the Agent.
Section 2.2        Collections Prior to Amortization.  Prior to the Amortization Date, any Collections and/or Deemed Collections received by the Servicer shall be set aside and held in trust by the Servicer for the benefit of the Agent and the Purchasers for the payment of any accrued and unpaid Aggregate Unpaids or for a Reinvestment as provided in this Section 2.2.  If at any time any Collections and/or Deemed Collections are received by the Servicer prior to the Amortization Date, (i) the Servicer shall set aside the Termination Percentage (hereinafter defined) of Collections evidenced by the Purchaser Interests of each Terminating Financial Institution, shall set aside Collections to be used to effect any Aggregate Reduction in accordance with Section 1.3 and shall set aside amounts necessary to pay Obligations due on the next succeeding Settlement Date and (ii) Seller hereby requests and the Purchasers (other than any Terminating Financial Institutions) hereby agree to make, simultaneously with such receipt, a reinvestment (each a “Reinvestment”) with that portion of the balance of each and every Collection and Deemed Collection received by the Servicer that is part of any Purchaser Interest (other than any Purchaser Interests of Terminating Financial Institutions), such that after giving effect to such Reinvestment, the amount of Capital of such Purchaser Interest immediately after such receipt and corresponding Reinvestment shall be equal to the amount of Capital immediately prior to such receipt (but giving effect to any ratable reduction thereof pursuant to application of an Aggregate Reduction).  On each Settlement Date prior to the occurrence of the Amortization Date, the Servicer shall remit to the Agent’s or applicable Purchaser’s account all amounts previously set aside that have not been subject to a Reinvestment and apply such amounts (if not previously paid in accordance with Section 2.1)  first, to reduce unpaid Obligations and second, to reduce the Capital of all Purchaser Interests of Terminating Financial Institutions,
Page 3
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED
RECEIVABLES PURCHASE AGREEMENT
  applied ratably to each Terminating Financial Institution according to its respective Termination Percentage.  If such Capital and Obligations shall be reduced to zero, any additional Collections received by the Servicer (i) if applicable, shall be remitted to the Agent’s or applicable Purchaser’s account no later than 1:00 pm (Eastern time) to the extent required to fund any Aggregate Reduction on such Settlement Date and (ii) any balance remaining thereafter shall be remitted from the Servicer to Seller on such Settlement Date. Each Terminating Financial Institution shall be allocated a ratable portion of Collections from the Liquidity Termination Date that such Terminating Financial Institution did not consent to extend (as to such Terminating Financial Institution, the “Liquidity Provider Termination Date”), until such Terminating Financial Institution’s Capital shall be paid in full.  This ratable portion shall be calculated on the Liquidity Provider Termination Date of each Terminating Financial Institution as a percentage equal to (i) Capital of such Terminating Financial Institution outstanding on its Liquidity Provider Termination Date, divided by (ii) the Aggregate Capital outstanding on such Liquidity Provider Termination Date (the “Termination Percentage”).  Each Terminating Financial Institution’s Termination Percentage shall remain constant prior to the Amortization Date.  On and after the Amortization Date, each Termination Percentage shall be disregarded, and each Terminating Financial Institution’s Capital shall be reduced ratably with all Financial Institutions in accordance with Section 2.3 and Section 2.4.
Section 2.3        Collections Following Amortization.  On the Amortization Date and on each day thereafter, the Servicer shall set aside and hold in trust, for the holder of each Purchaser Interest, all Collections received on such day and an additional amount for the payment of any Aggregate Unpaids owed by Seller and not previously paid by Seller in accordance with Section 2.1.  On and after the Amortization Date, the Servicer shall, at any time upon the request from time to time by (or pursuant to standing instructions from) the Agent (i) remit to the Agent’s or applicable Purchaser’s account the amounts set aside pursuant to the preceding sentence, and (ii) apply such amounts to reduce the Capital associated with each such Purchaser Interest and any other Aggregate Unpaids.
Section 2.4        Application of Collections.  If there shall be insufficient funds on deposit for the Servicer to distribute funds in payment in full of the aforementioned amounts pursuant to Section 2.2 or 2.3 (as applicable), the Servicer shall distribute funds:
first, to the payment of the Servicer’s reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses in connection with servicing, administering and collecting the Receivables, including the Servicing Fee, if Seller or one of its Affiliates is not then acting as the Servicer,
second, to the reimbursement of the Agent’s and the Purchasers’ costs of collection and enforcement of this Agreement,
third, ratably to the payment of all accrued and unpaid fees under the Fee Letters, CP Costs and Yield,
fourth, (to the extent applicable) to the ratable reduction of the Aggregate Capital (without regard to any Termination Percentage),
fifth, for the ratable payment of all other unpaid Obligations, provided that to the extent such Obligations relate to the payment of Servicer costs and expenses, including the Servicing Fee, when Seller or one of its Affiliates is acting as the Servicer, such costs and expenses will not be paid until after the payment in full of all other Obligations, and
sixth, after the Aggregate Unpaids have been indefeasibly reduced to zero, to Seller.
Collections applied to the payment of Aggregate Unpaids shall be distributed in accordance with the aforementioned provisions, and, giving effect to each of the priorities set forth in Section 2.4 above, shall be shared ratably (within each priority) among the Agent and the Purchasers in accordance with the amount of such Aggregate Unpaids owing to each of them in respect of each such priority.
Section 2.5        Payment Rescission.  No payment of any of the Aggregate Unpaids shall be considered paid or applied hereunder to the extent that, at any time, all or any portion of such payment or application
Page 4
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED
RECEIVABLES PURCHASE AGREEMENT
  is rescinded by application of law or judicial authority, or must otherwise be returned or refunded for any reason.  Seller shall remain obligated for the amount of any payment or application so rescinded, returned or refunded, and shall promptly pay to the Agent (for application to the Person or Persons who suffered such rescission, return or refund) the full amount thereof, plus the Default Fee from the date of any such rescission, return or refunding.
Section 2.6        Maximum Purchaser Interests.  In accordance with this Section 2.6, Seller shall ensure that the Purchaser Interests of the Purchasers shall at no time exceed in the aggregate 100%.  If as of the date of any Weekly Report or Monthly Report the aggregate of the Purchaser Interests of the Purchasers exceeds 100%, Seller shall pay to the Purchasers (ratably based on the ratio of each Purchaser’s Capital at such time to the Aggregate Capital at such time) within one Business Day an amount to be applied to reduce the Aggregate Capital, such that after giving effect to such payment the aggregate of the Purchaser Interests equals or is less than 100%.  If at any time (other than as of the date of any Weekly Report or Monthly Report) the aggregate of the Purchaser Interests of the Purchasers exceeds 100%, Seller shall pay to the Purchasers (ratably based on the ratio of each Purchaser’s Capital at such time to the Aggregate Capital at such time) within five Business Days an amount to be applied to reduce the Aggregate Capital, such that after giving effect to such payment the aggregate of the Purchaser Interests equals or is less than 100%.
Section 2.7        Repurchase Option.  In addition to Seller’s rights pursuant to Section 1.3, Seller (so long as Seller is an Affiliate of the Servicer) shall have the right (after providing written notice to the Agent (and upon receipt thereof the Agent will forward such notice to each Purchaser) no later than 1:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the date on which any repurchase of the outstanding Purchaser Interests is to occur), at any time, to repurchase from the Purchasers all, but not less than all, of the then outstanding Purchaser Interests.  The purchase price in respect thereof shall be an amount equal to the Aggregate Unpaids through the date of such repurchase, payable in immediately available funds.  Such repurchase shall be without representation, warranty or recourse of any kind by, on the part of, or against any Purchaser or the Agent.
Section 2.8        Release of Lock-Box Arrangements.  After all Aggregate Unpaids have been reduced to zero, the Agent and Purchasers agree that the Collection Account Agreements maintained pursuant to Section 7.1(j) hereof for the benefit of the Purchasers shall be terminated and any amounts remaining in such accounts shall be released to Seller, provided,  however, if any amounts paid to the Agent or Purchaser are voided, limited or otherwise required to be disgorged by any Purchaser in a bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other proceeding, each Seller Party hereby agrees to use its best efforts to reinstate such Lock-Box arrangements and Collection Account Agreements, and hereby grants a power of attorney (which shall be irrevocable and coupled with an interest) to the Agent and hereby authorizes the Agent, on its behalf, to execute Lock-Box arrangements and Collection Account Agreements in the event of any such reinstatement.
Section 2.9        Compliance with FATCA.  If a payment made to a Purchaser under the Agreement would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Purchaser were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller Parties and the Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Seller Parties or the Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Seller Parties or the Agent as may be necessary for the Seller Parties and the Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Purchaser has complied with its obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  In the event that a Purchaser does not deliver to the Seller Parties and the Agent the documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Seller Parties or the Agent, as required under this Section 2.9, the Seller Parties and the Agent shall be authorized to deduct from payments to be made to such Purchaser amounts representing taxes payable by such Purchaser under FATCA, as determined in the sole discretion of the Seller Parties or the Agent, and to remit such amounts to the applicable governmental authorities.  For purposes of this Section 2.9,  “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.

Section 3.1        CP Costs.  Seller shall pay CP Costs with respect to the Capital associated with each Purchaser Interest of the Companies for each day that any Capital in respect of any such Purchaser Interest is outstanding.
Section 3.2        CP Costs Payments.  On each Settlement Date, Seller shall pay to each Company an aggregate amount equal to all accrued and unpaid CP Costs in respect of the Capital associated with all Purchaser Interests of such Company for the immediately preceding Accrual Period in accordance with Article II.  On or before the third Business Day immediately preceding the Settlement Date for each Purchaser Interest of the Companies, the Agent shall calculate the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid CP Costs due and payable on the applicable Settlement Date and shall notify Seller of the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid CP Costs due and payable to each Company on the applicable Settlement Date.
Section 3.3        Calculation of CP Costs.  Subject to Section 3.4, the CP Costs for any Purchaser Interest held by the Companies shall be the LIBO Rate, and the Agent shall calculate the LIBO Rate applicable to each day in the applicable Accrual Period.
Section 3.4        Suspension of the LIBO Rate  If any Company notifies the Agent that it has determined that funding its Pro Rata Share of the Purchaser Interests of the Companies in such Company’s Purchaser Group at the LIBO Rate would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, or directive of any governmental or regulatory authority, whether or not having the force of law, or that (i) deposits of a type and maturity appropriate to match fund its Purchaser Interests at the LIBO Rate are not available or (ii) the LIBO Rate does not accurately reflect the cost of acquiring or maintaining a Purchaser Interest at the LIBO Rate, then the Agent shall suspend the availability of the LIBO Rate for the Companies in such Company’s Purchaser Group and CP Costs for any Purchaser Interest funded by the Companies in such Company’s Purchaser Group shall be the Alternative Base Rate.
ARTICLE IV
FINANCIAL INSTITUTION FUNDING
Section 4.1        Financial Institution Funding.  The Capital associated with the Purchaser Interests of the Financial Institutions shall accrue Yield for each day during its Tranche Period in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof.  Subject to Section 4.4, the Discount Rate for the Capital associated with any Purchaser Interests held by the Financial Institutions shall be the LIBO Rate, and the Agent shall calculate the LIBO Rate applicable to each day in the applicable Tranche Period.  If any Purchaser Interest of any Company is assigned or transferred to, or funded by, any Funding Source of such Company pursuant to any Funding Agreement or to or by any other Person, each such Purchaser Interest so assigned, transferred or funded shall each be deemed to have a new Tranche Period commencing on the date of any such transfer or funding and the Capital associated therewith shall accrue Yield for each day during the Tranche Period at the Discount Rate for the corresponding Accrual Period (or portion thereof) in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof as if each such Purchaser Interest was held by a Financial Institution, and with respect to each such Purchaser Interest, the assignee or transferee thereof or lender with respect thereto shall be deemed to be a Financial Institution in the transferring Company’s Purchaser Group solely for the purposes of Sections 4.1,  4.2,  4.3 and 4.4.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Financial Institution that is also a Company shall continue to receive CP Costs in accordance with Article III rather than Yield in accordance with this Article IV.

(a)       Prior to the Amortization Date, each Tranche Period will commence on the first day of each Accrual Period, or in the event a Financial Institution acquires any Purchaser Interest, on the date of such acquisition.  On and after the Amortization Date, the applicable Financial Institution shall select the Business Day on which any Tranche Period will commence.
(b)       Seller or the applicable Financial Institution, upon notice to and consent by the other received at least three Business Days prior to the end of a Tranche Period (the “Terminating Tranche”) for any Purchaser Interest, may, effective on the last day of the Terminating Tranche:  (i) divide any such Purchaser Interest into multiple Purchaser Interests by subdividing the associated Capital for such Purchaser Interest into smaller amounts of Capital, (ii) combine any such Purchaser Interest with one or more other Purchaser Interests that have a Terminating Tranche ending on the same day as such Terminating Tranche by combining the associated Capital for such Purchaser Interests or (iii) combine any such Purchaser Interest with a new Purchaser Interest to be purchased on the day such Terminating Tranche ends by combining the associated Capital for such Purchaser Interests; provided that in no event may a Purchaser Interest of any Purchaser be combined with a Purchaser Interest of any other Purchaser.
Section 4.4        Suspension of the LIBO Rate.  If any Financial Institution notifies the Agent that it has determined that funding its Pro Rata Share of the Purchaser Interests of the Financial Institutions in such Financial Institution’s Purchaser Group at the LIBO Rate would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, or directive of any governmental or regulatory authority, whether or not having the force of law, or that (i) deposits of a type and maturity appropriate to match fund its Purchaser Interests at the LIBO Rate are not available or (ii) the LIBO Rate does not accurately reflect the cost of acquiring or maintaining a Purchaser Interest at the LIBO Rate, then the Agent shall suspend the availability of the LIBO Rate for the Financial Institutions in such Financial Institution’s Purchaser Group and the Discount Rate for any Purchaser Interest funded by the Financial Institutions in such Financial Institution’s Purchaser Group shall be the Alternative Base Rate.
Section 4.5        Extension of Liquidity Termination Date.
(a)       Seller may request one or more 364‑day extensions of the Liquidity Termination Date then in effect by giving written notice of such request to the Agent (each such notice an “Extension Notice”) at least 60 days prior to the Liquidity Termination Date then in effect.  After the Agent’s receipt of any Extension Notice, the Agent shall promptly advise each Financial Institution of such Extension Notice.  Each Financial Institution may, in its sole discretion, by a revocable notice (a “Consent Notice”) given to the Agent on or prior to the 30th day prior to the Liquidity Termination Date then in effect (such period from the date of the Extension Notice to such 30th day being referred to herein as the “Consent Period”), consent to such extension of such Liquidity Termination Date; provided,  however, that, except as provided in Section 4.5(b), such extension shall not be effective with respect to any of the Financial Institutions if any one or more Financial Institutions:  (i) notifies the Agent during the Consent Period that such Financial Institution either does not wish to consent to such extension or wishes to revoke its prior Consent Notice or (ii) fails to respond to the Agent within the Consent Period (each Financial Institution that does not wish to consent to such extension or wishes to revoke its prior Consent Notice or fails to respond to the Agent within the Consent Period is herein referred to as a “Non-Renewing Financial Institution”).  If none of the events described in the foregoing clause (i) or (ii) occurs during the Consent Period and all Consent Notices have been received, then, the Liquidity Termination Date shall be irrevocably extended until the date that is 364 days after the Liquidity Termination Date then in effect.  The Agent shall promptly notify Seller of any Consent Notice or other notice received by the Agent pursuant to this Section 4.5(a).
(b)       Upon receipt of notice from the Agent pursuant to Section 4.5(a) of any Non-Renewing Financial Institution or that the Liquidity Termination Date has not been extended, one or more of the Financial Institutions (including any Non-Renewing Financial Institution) may proffer to the Agent and the Company in such Non-Renewing Financial Institution’s Purchaser Group the names of one or more institutions meeting the criteria set forth in Section 12.1(b)(i) that are willing to accept assignments of and assume the rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other applicable Transaction Documents of the Non-Renewing Financial Institution.  Provided the proffered name(s) are acceptable to the Agent and the Company in such Non-Renewing Financial Institution’s Purchaser Group, the Agent shall notify the remaining Financial Institutions of such fact, and the then

  existing Liquidity Termination Date shall be extended for an additional 364 days upon satisfaction of the conditions for an assignment in accordance with Section 12.1 and the Commitment of each Non-Renewing Financial Institution shall be reduced to zero.  If the rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other applicable Transaction Documents of each Non-Renewing Financial Institution are not assigned as contemplated by this Section 4.5(b) (each such Non-Renewing Financial Institution whose rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other applicable Transaction Documents are not so assigned is herein referred to as a “Terminating Financial Institution”) and at least one Financial Institution is not a Non-Renewing Financial Institution, the then existing Liquidity Termination Date shall be extended for an additional 364 days;  provided,  however, that (i) the Purchase Limit shall be reduced on the Liquidity Provider Termination Date applicable to each Terminating Financial Institution by an aggregate amount equal to the Terminating Commitment Availability of each Terminating Financial Institution as of such date and shall thereafter continue to be reduced by amounts equal to any reduction in the Capital of any Terminating Financial Institution (after application of Collections pursuant to Sections 2.2 and 2.3), (ii) the Company Purchase Limit of each Company shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of the Terminating Commitment Amount of each Terminating Financial Institution in such Company’s Purchaser Group and (iii) the Commitment of each Terminating Financial Institution shall be reduced to zero on the Liquidity Provider Termination Date applicable to such Terminating Financial Institution.  Upon reduction to zero of the Capital of all of the Purchaser Interests of a Terminating Financial Institution (after application of Collections thereto pursuant to Sections 2.2 and 2.3), all rights and obligations of such Terminating Financial Institution hereunder shall be terminated and such Terminating Financial Institution shall no longer be a “Financial Institution”;  provided,  however, that the provisions of Article X shall continue in effect for its benefit with respect to Purchaser Interests held by such Terminating Financial Institution prior to its termination as a Financial Institution.
(c)       Any requested extension may be approved or disapproved by a Financial Institution in its sole discretion.  In the event that the Commitments are not extended in accordance with the provisions of this Section 4.5, the Commitment of each Financial Institution shall be reduced to zero on the Liquidity Termination Date.  Upon reduction to zero of the Commitment of a Financial Institution and upon reduction to zero of the Capital of all of the Purchaser Interests of such Financial Institution all rights and obligations of such Financial Institution hereunder shall be terminated and such Financial Institution shall no longer be a “Financial Institution”;  provided,  however, that the provisions of Article X shall continue in effect for its benefit with respect to Purchaser Interests held by such Financial Institution prior to its termination as a Financial Institution.

All information heretofore furnished by such Seller Party or any of its Affiliates to the Agent or the Purchasers for purposes of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the other Transaction Documents or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby is, and all such information hereafter furnished by such Seller Party or any of its Affiliates to the Agent or the Purchasers will be, true and accurate in every material respect on the date such information is stated or certified and does not and will not contain any material misstatement of fact or omit to state a material fact or any fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading.
(h)       Use of Proceeds.  No proceeds of any purchase hereunder will be used by the Seller Parties (i) for a purpose that violates, or would be inconsistent with, Regulation T, U or X promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System from time to time or (ii) to acquire any security in any transaction which is subject to Section 12, 13 or 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

  (k)       Jurisdiction of Organization and Locations of Records.  The jurisdiction of organization of such Seller Party and the offices where it keeps all of its Records are located at the address(es) listed on Exhibit III or such other locations of which the Agent has been notified in accordance with Section 7.2(a) in jurisdictions where all action required by Section 7.1(h) and/or Section 13.4(a) has been taken and completed.  Seller’s organizational number assigned to it by its jurisdiction of organization and Seller’s Federal Employer Identification Number are correctly set forth on Exhibit III.  Seller has not changed its corporate structure or its jurisdiction of organization since the Initial Closing Date except in accordance with Section 7.2(a).  Seller is a Delaware corporation and is a “registered organization” (within the meaning of Section 9‑102 of the UCC in effect in the State of Delaware).  Servicer is a New York corporation and is a “registered organization” (within the meaning of Section 9‑102 of the UCC in effect in the State of New York).
(l)       Collections.  The conditions and requirements set forth in Section 7.1(j) and Section 8.2 have at all times been satisfied and duly performed.  The names and addresses of all Collection Banks, together with the account numbers of the Collection Accounts of Seller at each Collection Bank and the post office box number of each Lock-Box, are listed on Exhibit IV.  Seller has not granted any Person, other than the Agent as contemplated by this Agreement, dominion and control or “control” (within the meaning of Section 9‑104 of the UCC of all applicable jurisdictions) of any Lock-Box or Collection Account, or the right to take dominion and control or “control” (within the meaning of Section 9‑104 of the UCC of all applicable jurisdictions) of any such Lock-Box or Collection Account at a future time or upon the occurrence of a future event, in each case, that is or remains in effect from and after the Amendment Date.  Seller has taken all steps necessary to ensure that the Agent has “control” (within the meaning of Section 9‑104 of the UCC of all applicable jurisdictions) over all its Collection Accounts and Lock-Boxes.
(m)       Material Adverse Effect. (i) The initial Servicer represents and warrants that since July 2, 2017, no event has occurred that would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or operations of the initial Servicer and its Subsidiaries or the ability of the initial Servicer to perform its obligations under this Agreement, and (ii) Seller represents and warrants that since July 2, 2017, no event has occurred that would have a material adverse effect on (A) the financial condition or operations of Seller, (B) the ability of Seller to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents, or (C) the collectibility of the Receivables generally or any material portion of the Receivables.
(n)       Names.  In the past five (5) years, Seller has not used any corporate names, trade names or assumed names other than the name in which it has executed this Agreement.
(o)       Ownership of Seller.  Originator owns, directly or indirectly, 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Seller, free and clear of any Adverse Claim.  Such capital stock is validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and there are no options, warrants or other rights to acquire securities of Seller.
(p)       Not an Investment Company.  Such Seller Party is not, and is not controlled by, an “investment company” registered or required to be registered under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), and is not a “covered fund” under Section 13 of the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder (the “Volcker Rule”).  In determining that it is not a “covered fund” under the Volcker Rule, although other exemptions or exclusions under the Investment Company Act may apply, Seller relies on the exemption from the definition of “investment company” set forth in Section 3(c)(5) of the Investment Company Act and does not rely solely on the exemption from the definition of “investment company” set forth in Section 3(c)(1) and/or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act.
(q)       Compliance with Law.  Such Seller Party has complied in all respects with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, orders, writs, judgments, injunctions, decrees or awards to which it may be subject, except where the failure to so comply could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  Seller represents that each Receivable, together with the Contract related thereto, does not contravene any laws, rules or regulations applicable thereto (including,  without limitation, laws, rules and regulations relating to truth in lending, fair credit billing, fair credit reporting, equal credit opportunity, fair debt collection practices and privacy), and no part of such Contract is in violation of any such law, rule or regulation.
(r)       Compliance with Credit and Collection Policy.  Seller has complied in all material respects with the Credit and Collection Policy with regard to each Receivable and the related Contract, and has not
Page 10
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED
RECEIVABLES PURCHASE AGREEMENT
  made any material change to the Credit and Collection Policy, except as permitted in accordance with Section 7.2(c) and except such material change as to which the Agent has been notified in accordance with Section 7.1(a)(vii).
(s)       Payments to Originator.  Seller represents that with respect to each Receivable transferred to Seller under the Receivables Sale Agreement, Seller has given reasonably equivalent value to Originator in consideration therefor and such transfer was not made for or on account of an antecedent debt.  Seller represents that no transfer by Originator of any Receivable under the Receivables Sale Agreement is or may be voidable under any section of the Federal Bankruptcy Code.
(t)       Enforceability of Contracts.  Seller represents that each Contract with respect to each Receivable is effective to create, and has created, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the related Obligor to pay the Outstanding Balance of the Receivable created thereunder and any accrued interest thereon, if any, enforceable against the Obligor in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws relating to or limiting creditors’ rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).
(u)       Eligible Receivables.  Each Receivable included in the Net Receivables Balance as an Eligible Receivable on the date of its purchase under the Receivables Sale Agreement was an Eligible Receivable on such purchase date.
(v)       Aggregate Capital.  Seller has determined that, immediately after giving effect to each purchase hereunder, the Aggregate Capital is no greater than 100% of the amount equal to (i) the Net Receivables Balance, minus (ii) the Required Reserves.
(w)       Accounting.  The manner in which such Seller Party accounts for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Receivables Sale Agreement does not jeopardize the true sale analysis of the sale of Receivables by Originator to Seller.
(x)       Sanctions.  Neither the Seller Parties, nor any of their respective Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of the Seller Parties or their respective Subsidiaries, any director, officer, employee, agent, affiliate or representative of the Seller Parties or their respective Subsidiaries, is an individual or entity that is (i) currently the subject or target of any Sanctions or (ii) located, organized or resident in any country or territory to the extent that such country or territory itself is the subject of any country-wide Sanction.
(y)       PATRIOT Act.  To the extent applicable, each Seller Party is in compliance, in all material respects, with the Patriot Act.
Section 5.2        Financial Institution Representations and Warranties.  Each Financial Institution hereby represents and warrants to the Agent and the Company in such Financial Institution’s Purchaser Group that:
(a)       Existence and Power.  Such Financial Institution is a corporation or a banking association duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, and has all corporate power to perform its obligations hereunder.
(b)       No Conflict.  The execution and delivery by such Financial Institution of this Agreement and the performance of its obligations hereunder are within its corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, do not contravene or violate (i) its certificate or articles of incorporation or association or by-laws, (ii) any law, rule or regulation applicable to it, (iii) any restrictions under any agreement, contract or instrument to which it is a party or by which any of its property is bound, or (iv) any order, writ, judgment, award, injunction or decree binding on or affecting it or its property, and do not result in the creation or imposition of any Adverse Claim on its assets.  This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by such Financial Institution.
(c)       Governmental Authorization.  No authorization or approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body is required for the due execution and delivery
Page 11
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED

  by such Financial Institution of this Agreement and the performance of its obligations hereunder, except that has already been received.
(d)       Binding Effect.  This Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Financial Institution enforceable against such Financial Institution in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws relating to or limiting creditors’ rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).

(e)       Keeping and Marking of Records and Books.
(i) The Servicer will maintain and implement administrative and operating procedures (including,  without limitation, an ability to recreate records evidencing Receivables in the event of the destruction of the originals thereof), and keep and maintain all documents, books, records and other information reasonably necessary or advisable for the collection of all Receivables (including,  without limitation, records adequate to permit the immediate identification of each new Receivable and all Collections of and adjustments to each existing Receivable).

(i)       Purchasers’ Reliance.  Seller acknowledges that the Purchasers are entering into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in reliance upon Seller’s identity as a legal entity that is separate from Originator.

(F) at all times have a Board of Directors consisting of three members, at least one member of which is an Independent Director;
(G) observe all corporate formalities as a distinct entity, and ensure that all corporate actions relating to (A) the selection, maintenance or replacement of the Independent Director, (B) the dissolution or liquidation of Seller or (C) the initiation of, participation in, acquiescence in or consent to any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceeding involving Seller, are duly authorized by unanimous vote of its Board of Directors (including the Independent Director);

(M) maintain its corporate charter in conformity with this Agreement, such that (1) it does not amend, restate, supplement or otherwise modify its Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws in any respect that would impair its ability to comply with the terms or provisions of any of the Transaction Documents, including, without limitation, Section 7.1(i) of this Agreement; and (2) its corporate charter, at all times that this Agreement is in effect, provides for not less than 10 days’ prior written notice to the Agent of the replacement or appointment of any director that is to serve as an Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement and the condition precedent to giving effect to such replacement or appointment that Seller certify that the designated Person satisfied the criteria set forth in the definition herein of “Independent Director” and the Agent’s written acknowledgement that in its reasonable judgment the designated Person satisfies the criteria set forth in the definition herein of “Independent Director;”
(N) maintain the effectiveness of, and continue to perform under the Receivables Sale Agreement, such that it does not amend, restate, supplement, cancel, terminate or otherwise modify the Receivables Sale Agreement, or give any consent, waiver, directive or approval thereunder or waive any default, action, omission or breach under the Receivables Sale Agreement or otherwise grant any indulgence thereunder, without (in each case) the prior written consent of the Agent and the Required Purchasers;

(Q) take such other actions as are necessary on its part to ensure that the facts and assumptions set forth in the opinion issued by Covington & Burling LLP, as counsel for Seller, in connection with this Agreement and relating to true sale and substantive consolidation issues  with respect to Originator and Seller, and in the certificates accompanying such opinion, remain true and correct in all material respects at all times.
(j)       Collections. Such Seller Party will cause (1) all proceeds from all Lock-Boxes to be directly deposited by a Collection Bank into a Collection Account and (2) each Lock-Box and Collection Account to be subject at all times to a Collection Account Agreement that is in full force and effect.  In the event any payments relating to Receivables are remitted directly to Seller or any Affiliate of Seller, Seller will remit (or will cause all such payments to be remitted) directly to a Collection Bank and deposited into a Collection Account within two Business Days following receipt thereof, and, at all times prior to such remittance, Seller will itself hold or, if applicable, will cause such payments to be held in trust for the exclusive benefit of the Agent and the Purchasers.  Seller will maintain exclusive ownership, dominion and control (subject to the terms of this Agreement) of each Lock-Box and Collection Account and shall not grant the right to take dominion and control or establish “control” (within the meaning of Section 9‑104 of the UCC of all applicable jurisdictions) of any Lock-Box or Collection Account at a future time or upon the occurrence of a future event to any Person, except to the Agent as contemplated by this Agreement.  With respect to any Lock-Box or Collection Account, Seller shall take all steps necessary to ensure that the Agent has “control” (within the meaning of Section 9‑104 of the UCC of all applicable jurisdictions) over such Lock-Box or Collection Account.  So long as no Amortization Event or Potential Amortization Event shall have occurred and be continuing, the Servicer will be permitted to transfer proceeds from a Lock-Box or Collection Account to another account of Servicer, provided that at all times Servicer will hold such payments or, if applicable, will cause such payments to be held in trust for the exclusive benefit of the Agent and the Purchasers subject to application pursuant to Sections 2.2 and 2.3 hereof.
(k)       Taxes.  Such Seller Party will file all tax returns and reports required by law to be filed by it and will promptly pay all taxes and governmental charges at any time owing.  Seller will pay when due any taxes payable in connection with the Receivables, exclusive of taxes on or measured by income or gross receipts of any Company, the Agent or any Financial Institution.
(l)       Insurance.  Seller will maintain in effect, or cause to be maintained in effect, at Seller’s own expense, such liability insurance as Seller shall deem appropriate in its good faith business judgment.  The Agent, for the benefit of the Purchasers, shall be named as an additional insured with respect to all such liability insurance maintained by Seller.  Seller will pay or cause to be paid, the premiums therefor and deliver to the Agent evidence satisfactory to the Agent of such insurance coverage.  Copies of each policy shall be furnished to the Agent and any Purchaser in certificated form upon the Agent’s or such Purchaser’s request.  The foregoing requirements shall not be construed to negate, reduce or modify, and are in addition to, Seller’s obligations hereunder.
(m)       Payment to Originator.  With respect to any Receivable purchased by Seller from Originator, such sale shall be effected under, and in strict compliance with the terms of, the Receivables Sale Agreement, including,  without limitation, the terms relating to the amount and timing of payments to be made to Originator in respect of the purchase price for such Receivable.

RECEIVABLES PURCHASE AGREEMENT
  (p)       General Ledger and Certain Receivables.  Such Seller Party shall maintain its consolidated general accounting ledger such that all indebtedness and other obligations owed to Originator or in which Originator has a security interest or other interest arising in connection with the sale of merchandise or the rendering of services by Originator and sold to Seller are recorded as part of general ledger category “company code US10”;  provided, however, that from and after December 28, 2010 indebtedness or other obligations owed to Originator or in which Originator has a security interest or other interest arising in connection with the sale of merchandise or the rendering of services by the business previously conducted by businesses acquired by Originator in an Excluded Acquisition shall not be recorded as part of general ledger category “company code US10” until such time, if any, as such indebtedness or other obligations are originated, serviced and collected in a manner substantially similar to the Receivables.
(q)       Anti-Corruption Laws; Sanctions.  Each Seller Party will maintain in effect and enforce policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance by it and its directors, officers, employees and agents with Anti-Corruption Laws and applicable Sanctions.
Section 7.2        Negative Covenants of the Seller Parties.  Until the date on which the Aggregate Unpaids have been indefeasibly paid in full and this Agreement terminates in accordance with its terms, each Seller Party hereby covenants, as to itself (and not as to any other Seller Party), that:

Such Seller Party will not change its name, identity, jurisdiction of organization or corporate structure (within the meaning of Sections 9‑503 and/or 9‑507 of the UCC of all applicable jurisdictions) or relocate any office where Records are kept unless it shall have:  (i) given the Agent at least 45 days’ prior written notice thereof and (ii) delivered to the Agent all financing statements, instruments and other documents requested by the Agent in connection with such change or relocation.
(b)       Change in Payment Instructions to Obligors.  Except as may be required by the Agent pursuant to Section 8.2(b), such Seller Party will not add or terminate any bank as a Collection Bank, or make any change in the instructions to Obligors regarding payments to be made to any Lock-Box or Collection Account, unless the Agent shall have received, at least 10 days before the proposed effective date therefor, (i) written notice of such addition, termination or change and (ii) with respect to the addition of a Collection Bank or a Collection Account or Lock-Box, an executed Collection Account Agreement with respect to the new Collection Account or Lock-Box; provided,  however, that the Servicer may make changes in instructions to Obligors regarding payments if such new instructions require such Obligors to make payments to another existing Collection Account.
(c)       Modifications to Contracts and Credit and Collection Policy.  Such Seller Party will not make any change to the Credit and Collection Policy that could adversely affect the collectibility of the Receivables or decrease the credit quality of any newly created Receivables.  Except as provided in Section 8.2(d), the Servicer will not extend, amend or otherwise modify the terms of any Receivable or any Contract related thereto other than in accordance with the Credit and Collection Policy.
(d)       Sales, Liens.  Seller will not sell, assign (by operation of law or otherwise) or otherwise dispose of, or grant any option with respect to, or create or suffer to exist any Adverse Claim upon (including,  without limitation, the filing of any financing statement) or with respect to, any of its Receivables, Related Security or Collections, or upon or with respect to any Contract under which any of its Receivables arise, or any Lock-Box or Collection Account, or assign any right to receive income with respect thereto (other than, in each case, the creation of the interests therein in favor of the Agent and the Purchasers provided for herein), and Seller will defend the right, title and interest of the Agent and the Purchasers in, to and under any of the foregoing property, against all claims of third parties claiming through or under Seller or Originator.
(e)       Aggregate Capital.  Other than in compliance with Section 2.6, at no time prior to the Amortization Date shall Seller permit the Aggregate Capital to be greater than 100% of the amount equal to (i) the Net Receivables Balance, minus (ii) the Required Reserves.
(f)       Termination Date Determination.  Seller will not designate the Termination Date (as defined in the Receivables Sale Agreement), or send any written notice to Originator in respect thereof, without

  the prior written consent of the Agent, except with respect to the occurrence of such Termination Date arising pursuant to Section 5.1(d) of the Receivables Sale Agreement.
(g)       Restricted Junior Payments.  From and after the occurrence of any Amortization Event, Seller will not make any Restricted Junior Payment if, after giving effect thereto, Seller would fail to meet its obligations set forth in Section 7.2(e).
(h)       Anti-Corruption Laws; Sanctions.  Seller shall not, directly or indirectly, sell any Purchaser Interest, and it will not knowingly use or procure for the use of Seller, Avnet or any of Avnet’s Subsidiaries, the proceeds of the sale of any Purchaser Interest to fund any activities of or business with any individual or entity, or in any Sanctioned Country, that, at the time of such funding, is the subject of Sanctions, or in any other manner that will result in a violation by any individual or entity of Sanctions.  Seller shall not, directly or indirectly, knowingly use or procure for the use of Seller, Avnet or any of Avnet’s Subsidiaries, the proceeds of the sale of any Purchaser Interest for any purpose which would breach Anti-Corruption Laws.

ADMINISTRATION AND COLLECTION
Section 8.1        Designation of Servicer. (a) The servicing, administration and collection of the Receivables shall be conducted by such Person (the “Servicer”) so designated from time to time in accordance with this Section 8.1.  Avnet is hereby designated as, and hereby agrees to perform the duties and obligations of, the Servicer pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  The Agent (on behalf of the Purchasers) may, and at the direction of the Required Purchasers shall, at any time after the occurrence of any Amortization Event, designate as Servicer any Person to succeed Avnet or any successor Servicer.
(b)       Without the prior written consent of the Agent and the Required Purchasers, Avnet shall not be permitted to delegate any of its duties or responsibilities as Servicer to any Person other than (i) Seller and (ii) with respect to certain Charged-Off Receivables, outside collection agencies or law firms, taking action in connection with collection activities, in accordance with its customary practices.  Seller shall not be permitted to further delegate to any other Person any of the duties or responsibilities of the Servicer delegated to it by Avnet.  If at any time the Agent shall designate as Servicer any Person other than Avnet, all duties and responsibilities theretofore delegated by Avnet to Seller may, at the discretion of the Agent, be terminated forthwith on notice given by the Agent to Avnet and to Seller.
(c)       Notwithstanding the foregoing subsection (b), (i) Avnet shall be and remain primarily liable to the Agent and the Purchasers for the full and prompt performance of all duties and responsibilities of the Servicer hereunder (unless a successor servicer has been designated by the Agent pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof) and (ii) the Agent and the Purchasers shall be entitled to deal exclusively with Avnet in matters relating to the discharge by the Servicer of its duties and responsibilities hereunder.  The Agent and the Purchasers shall not be required to give notice, demand or other communication to any Person other than Avnet in order for communication to the Servicer and its sub-servicer or other delegate with respect thereto to be accomplished.  Avnet, at all times that it is the Servicer, shall be responsible for providing any sub-servicer or other delegate of the Servicer with any notice given to the Servicer under this Agreement.
Section 8.2        Duties of Servicer. (a) The Servicer shall take or cause to be taken all such actions as may be necessary or advisable to collect each Receivable from time to time, all in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, with reasonable care and diligence, and in accordance with the Credit and Collection Policy.
(b)       The Servicer will instruct all Obligors to pay all Collections directly to a Lock-Box or Collection Account.  The Servicer shall ensure that at all relevant times a Collection Account Agreement has been entered into and is in effect with each bank at which a Collection Account has been established.  In the case of any remittances received in any Lock-Box or Collection Account that shall have been identified, to the satisfaction of the Servicer, to not constitute Collections or other proceeds of the Receivables or the Related Security, the Servicer shall promptly remit such items to the Person identified to it as being the owner of such remittances.  From and after the
Page 20
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED
RECEIVABLES PURCHASE AGREEMENT
  date the Agent delivers to any Collection Bank a Collection Notice pursuant to Section 8.3, the Agent may request that the Servicer, and the Servicer thereupon promptly shall instruct all Obligors with respect to the Receivables to, remit all payments thereon to a new depositary account specified by the Agent and, at all times thereafter, Seller and the Servicer shall not deposit or otherwise credit, and shall not permit any other Person to deposit or otherwise credit to such new depositary account any cash or payment item other than Collections.  The Agent shall notify each Financial Institution of such new depositary account.
(c)       The Servicer shall administer the Collections in accordance with the procedures described herein and in Article II.  The Servicer shall set aside and hold in trust for the account of Seller and the Purchasers their respective shares of the Collections in accordance with Article II.  The Servicer shall, upon the request of the Agent, segregate, in a manner acceptable to the Agent, all cash, checks and other instruments received by it from time to time constituting Collections from the general funds of the Servicer or Seller prior to the remittance thereof in accordance with Article II.  If the Servicer shall be required to segregate Collections pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Servicer shall segregate and deposit with a bank designated by the Agent such allocable share of Collections of Receivables set aside for the Purchasers on the first Business Day following receipt by the Servicer of such Collections, duly endorsed or with duly executed instruments of transfer.
(d)       The Servicer may, in accordance with the Credit and Collection Policy, extend the maturity of any Receivable or adjust the Outstanding Balance of any Receivable as the Servicer determines to be appropriate to maximize Collections thereof; provided,  however, that such extension or adjustment shall not alter the status of such Receivable as a Delinquent Receivable or Charged-Off Receivable or limit the rights of the Agent or the Purchasers under this Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Agent shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to direct the Servicer to take all actions that a reasonable business person, exercising prudent business judgment, would undertake to commence or settle any legal action with respect to any Receivable or to foreclose upon or repossess any Related Security.
(e)       The Servicer shall hold in trust for Seller and the Purchasers all Records that (i) evidence or relate to the Receivables, the related Contracts and Related Security or (ii) are otherwise necessary or desirable to collect the Receivables and shall, as soon as practicable upon demand of the Agent, deliver or make available to the Agent all such Records, at a place selected by the Agent.  The Servicer shall, as soon as practicable following receipt thereof turn over to Seller any cash collections or other cash proceeds received with respect to Indebtedness owed to Seller not constituting Receivables.  The Servicer shall, from time to time at the request of any Purchaser, furnish to the Purchasers (promptly after any such request) a calculation of the amounts set aside for the Purchasers pursuant to Article II.
(f)       Any payment by an Obligor in connection with any Receivables in respect of any indebtedness owed by it to Originator or Seller shall, except as otherwise specified by such Obligor or otherwise required by contract or law and unless otherwise instructed by the Agent, be applied as a Collection of any Receivable of such Obligor (starting with the oldest such Receivable) to the extent of any amounts then due and payable thereunder before being applied to any other receivable or other obligation of such Obligor.
Section 8.3        Collection Notices.  The Agent is authorized at any time after the occurrence of any Amortization Event to date and to deliver to the Collection Banks the Collection Notices.  The Agent agrees to notify Seller promptly after the delivery of such Collection Notices to the Collection Banks.  Seller hereby transfers to the Agent for the benefit of the Purchasers, effective when the Agent delivers such notice, the dominion and control and “control” (within the meaning of Section 9‑104 of the UCC of all applicable jurisdictions) of each Lock-Box, each Collection Account and the amounts on deposit therein.  In case any authorized signatory of Seller whose signature appears on a Collection Account Agreement shall cease to have such authority before the delivery of such notice, such Collection Notice shall nevertheless be valid as if such authority had remained in force.  Seller hereby authorizes the Agent, and agrees that the Agent shall be entitled to (i) endorse Seller’s name on checks and other instruments representing Collections, (ii) enforce the Receivables, the related Contracts and the Related Security and (iii) take such action as shall be necessary or desirable to cause all cash, checks and other instruments constituting Collections of Receivables to come into the possession of the Agent rather than Seller.  The Agent agrees that after delivery of a Collection Notice, the Collection Banks may continue to provide or otherwise make available to Seller and the Servicer copies of all correspondence or other mail which will be sent directly to the Agent subsequent to the delivery of such Collection Notice pursuant to the Collection Account Agreements.

(xii) the failure to have filed, or any delay in filing, financing statements or other similar instruments or documents under the UCC (or any comparable law) of any applicable jurisdiction or other applicable laws with respect to any Receivable, the Related Security and Collections with respect thereto, and the proceeds of any thereof, whether at the time of any Incremental Purchase or Reinvestment or at any subsequent time;
(xiii) any action or omission by any Seller Party which reduces or impairs the rights of the Agent or the Purchasers with respect to any Receivable or the value of any such Receivable;
(xiv) any attempt by any Person to void any Incremental Purchase or Reinvestment hereunder under statutory provisions or common law or equitable action; and

(i) Indemnified Amounts to the extent a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction holds that such Indemnified Amounts resulted from gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Indemnified Party seeking indemnification;
(ii)  Indemnified Amounts to the extent the same includes losses in respect of Receivables that are uncollectible on account of the insolvency, bankruptcy or lack of creditworthiness of the related Obligor; or
(iii)  taxes imposed by the jurisdiction in which such Indemnified Party’s principal executive office is located, on or measured by the overall net income of such Indemnified Party to the extent that the computation of such taxes is consistent with the characterization for income tax purposes of the acquisition by the Purchasers of Purchaser Interests as a loan or loans by the Purchasers to Seller secured by the Receivables, the Related Security, the Collection Accounts and the Collections;
provided,  however, that nothing contained in this sentence shall limit the liability of Servicer or limit the recourse of the Purchasers to Servicer for amounts otherwise specifically provided to be paid by Servicer under the terms of this Agreement.
Section 10.2        Increased Cost and Reduced Return. (a) If any Regulatory Requirement (i) subjects any Purchaser or any Funding Source to any charge or withholding on or with respect to any Funding Agreement or this Agreement or a Purchaser’s or Funding Source’s obligations under a Funding Agreement or this Agreement, or on or with respect to the Receivables, or changes the basis of taxation of payments to any Purchaser or any Funding Source of any amounts payable under any Funding Agreement or this Agreement (except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of a Purchaser or Funding Source or taxes excluded by Section 10.1) or (ii) imposes, modifies or deems applicable any reserve, assessment, fee, tax, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or liabilities of a Funding Source or a Purchaser, or credit extended by a Funding Source or a Purchaser pursuant to a Funding Agreement or this Agreement or (iii) imposes any other condition the result of which is to increase the cost to a Funding Source or a Purchaser of performing

RECEIVABLES PURCHASE AGREEMENT
  its obligations under a Funding Agreement or this Agreement, or to reduce the rate of return on a Funding Source’s or Purchaser’s capital or assets as a consequence of its obligations under a Funding Agreement or this Agreement, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by a Funding Source or a Purchaser under a Funding Agreement or this Agreement, or to require any payment calculated by reference to the amount of interests or loans held or interest received by it, then, upon demand by the Agent, which demand shall be made at least 30 days prior to the date of any payment by Seller pursuant to this Section 10.2 and shall include an explanation in reasonable detail of the manner in which such amounts shall have been determined, Seller shall pay to the Agent, for the benefit of the relevant Funding Source or Purchaser, such amounts charged to such Funding Source or Purchaser or such amounts to otherwise compensate such Funding Source or such Purchaser for such increased cost or such reduction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Seller shall not be liable for any amounts for any such costs or reduced returns incurred by the party demanding payment under this Section 10.2 more than 90 days before the related demand for payment.  The term “Regulatory Requirement” shall mean (i) the adoption after August 26, 2010 of any applicable law, rule or regulation (including any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy or liquidity coverage) or any change therein after August 26, 2010, (ii) any change after August 26, 2010 in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, or (iii) the compliance, whether commenced prior to or after August 25, 2011, by any Funding Source or Purchaser with (A) the final rule titled Risk-Based Capital Guidelines; Capital Adequacy Guidelines; Capital Maintenance: Regulatory Capital; Impact of Modifications to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles; Consolidation of Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Programs; and Other Related Issues, adopted by the United States bank regulatory agencies on December 15, 2009, (B) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as amended from time to time, (C) any requests, rules, regulations, guidelines or directives promulgated in connection with the foregoing by any such agency or (D) any requests, rules, regulations, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III.
(b)       A certificate of the applicable Purchaser or Funding Source setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Purchaser or Funding Source pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 10.2 shall be delivered to Seller and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(c)       If any Purchaser or any Funding Source has or anticipates having any claim for compensation from Seller pursuant to clause (iii) of the definition of Regulatory Requirement appearing in paragraph (a) of this Section 10.2, and such Purchaser or Funding Source,  or Seller or the Servicer (each, an “Electing Party”) believes that having the facility publicly rated by one credit rating agency would reduce the amount of such compensation by an amount deemed by such Electing Party to be material, such Electing Party shall provide written notice to the related Consenting Parties (as defined below), Seller and the Servicer, as applicable (a “Ratings Request”), that such Electing Party intends to request a public rating of the facility from one credit rating agency, selected by a Purchaser or Funding Source that is an Electing Party or a Consenting Party (as defined below)  and reasonably acceptable to Seller, of at least A-, A3 or the equivalent (the “Required Rating”).  If the Electing Party is either Seller or the Servicer, then such Ratings Request will only be made with the consent of the related Purchasers or Funding Sources for which the Electing Party believes the compensation will be materially reduced (each, a “Consenting Party”), it being understood that any consent given by a Consenting Party with respect to a Ratings Request will not, in itself, be deemed to be consent to any reduction in compensation.  Seller and the Servicer agree that they shall cooperate with such Electing Party’s efforts to obtain the Required Rating, and shall provide the applicable credit rating agency (either directly or through distribution to the Agent or Electing Party) any information requested by such credit rating agency for purposes of providing and monitoring the Required Rating.  Each Consenting Party electing to receive the related ratings letter and each Electing Party shall share the cost of the initial fees payable to the credit rating agency for providing the related rating and all ongoing fees payable to the credit rating agency for its continued monitoring of the related rating.  Nothing in this Section 10.2(c) shall preclude any Purchaser or Funding Source from demanding compensation from Seller pursuant to Section 10.2(a) hereof at any time and without regard to whether the Required Rating shall have been obtained, or shall require any Purchaser or Funding Source to obtain any rating on the facility prior to demanding any such compensation from Seller.
Section 10.3        Other Costs and Expenses.  Seller shall pay to the Agent and each Purchaser on demand all reasonable and documented costs and out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the preparation, execution,

Seller shall pay to the Agent and each Purchaser on demand any and all costs and expenses of the Agent and the Purchasers, if any, including reasonable counsel fees and expenses in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement and the other documents delivered hereunder and in connection with any restructuring or workout of this Agreement or such documents, or the administration of this Agreement following an Amortization Event.

In performing its functions and duties hereunder and under the other Transaction Documents, the Agent shall act solely as agent for the Purchasers and does not assume nor shall be deemed to have assumed any obligation or relationship of trust or agency with or for any Seller Party or any of such Seller Party’s successors or assigns.  The Agent shall not be required to take any action that exposes the Agent to personal liability or that is contrary to this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or applicable law.  The appointment and authority of the Agent hereunder shall terminate upon the indefeasible payment in full of all Aggregate Unpaids.  Each Purchaser hereby authorizes the Agent to execute each of the UCC financing or continuation statements (and amendments thereto and assignments or terminations thereof) on behalf of such Purchaser (the terms of which shall be binding on such Purchaser).
Section 11.2        Delegation of Duties.  The Agent may execute any of its duties under this Agreement and each other Transaction Document by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties.

Section 11.3        Exculpatory Provisions.  Neither the Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Transaction Document (except for its, their or such Person’s own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Purchasers for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any Seller Party contained in this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received under or in connection with, this Agreement, or any other Transaction Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement, or any other Transaction Document or any other document furnished in connection herewith or therewith, or for any failure of any Seller Party to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder, or for the satisfaction of any condition specified in Article VI, or for the perfection, priority, condition, value or sufficiency of any collateral pledged in connection herewith.  The Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Purchaser to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements or covenants contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of the Seller Parties.  The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any Amortization Event or Potential Amortization Event unless the Agent has received notice from Seller or a Purchaser.
Section 11.4        Reliance by Agent.  The Agent shall in all cases be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including,

  without limitation, counsel to Seller), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Agent.  The Agent shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Purchasers or all of the Purchasers, as applicable, as it deems appropriate and it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Purchasers, provided that unless and until the Agent shall have received such advice, the Agent may take or refrain from taking any action, as the Agent shall deem advisable and in the best interests of the Purchasers.  The Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, in accordance with a request of the Required Purchasers or all of the Purchasers, as applicable, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Purchasers.
Section 11.5        Non-Reliance on Agent and Other Purchasers.  Each Purchaser expressly acknowledges that neither the Agent, nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates has made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by the Agent hereafter taken, including,  without limitation, any review of the affairs of any Seller Party, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Agent.  Each Purchaser represents and warrants to the Agent that it has and will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Purchaser and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property, prospects, financial and other conditions and creditworthiness of Seller and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and all other documents related hereto or thereto.
Section 11.6        Reimbursement and Indemnification.  Each Financial Institution agrees to reimburse and indemnify the Agent and its officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents ratably based on the ratio of each such indemnifying Financial Institution’s Commitment to the aggregate Commitment, to the extent not paid or reimbursed by the Seller Parties (i) for any amounts for which the Agent, acting in its capacity as Agent, is entitled to reimbursement by the Seller Parties hereunder and (ii) for any other expenses incurred by the Agent, in its capacity as Agent and acting on behalf of the Purchasers, in connection with the administration and enforcement of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.
Section 11.7        Agent in its Individual Capacity.  The Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with Seller or any Affiliate of Seller as though the Agent were not the Agent hereunder.  With respect to the acquisition of Purchaser Interests pursuant to this Agreement, the Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement in its individual capacity as any Purchaser and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the terms “Company,” “Financial Institution,” “Purchaser,” “Related Financial Institution,” “Financial Institutions,” “Purchasers,” and “Related Financial Institutions,” shall include the Agent in its individual capacity.
Section 11.8        Successor Agent.  The Agent may, upon five days’ notice to Seller and the Purchasers, and the Agent will, upon the direction of all of the Purchasers (other than the Agent, in its individual capacity), resign as Agent.  If the Agent shall resign, then the Required Purchasers during such five-day period shall appoint from among the Purchasers a successor agent.  If for any reason no successor Agent is appointed by the Required Purchasers during such five-day period, then effective upon the termination of such five-day period, the Purchasers shall perform all of the duties of the Agent hereunder and under the other Transaction Documents and Seller and the Servicer (as applicable) shall make all payments in respect of the Aggregate Unpaids directly to the applicable Purchasers and for all purposes shall deal directly with the Purchasers.

(c)        Each of the Financial Institutions agrees that in the event that it shall cease to have a short-term debt rating of A‑1 or better by S&P and P‑1 by Moody’s (an “Affected Financial Institution”), such Affected Financial Institution shall be obliged, at the request of the Company in such Affected Financial Institution’s Purchaser Group or the Agent, to assign all of its rights and obligations hereunder to (x) another Financial Institution in such Affected Financial Institution’s Purchaser Group or (y) another funding entity nominated by the Agent or any Financial Institution and acceptable to the Company in such Affected Financial Institution’s Purchaser Group, and willing to participate in this Agreement through the Liquidity Termination Date in the place of such Affected Financial Institution; provided that the Affected Financial Institution receives payment in full, pursuant to an Assignment Agreement, of an amount equal to such Financial Institution’s Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate Capital and Yield owing to the Financial Institutions in such Affected Financial Institution’s Purchaser Group and all accrued but unpaid fees and other costs and expenses payable in respect of its Pro Rata Share of the Purchaser Interests of the Financial Institutions in such Affected Financial Institution’s Purchaser Group.
Section 12.2        Participations.  Any Financial Institution may, in the ordinary course of its business at any time sell to one or more Persons (each a “Participant”) participating interests in its Pro Rata Share of the Purchaser Interests of the Financial Institutions in such Financial Institution’s Purchaser Group or any other interest of such Financial Institution hereunder.  Notwithstanding any such sale by a Financial Institution of a participating interest to a Participant, such Financial Institution’s rights and obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, such Financial Institution shall remain solely responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder, and Seller, each Company and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Financial Institution in connection with such Financial Institution’s rights and obligations under this Agreement.  Each Financial Institution agrees that any agreement between such Financial Institution and any such Participant in respect of such participating interest shall not restrict such Financial Institution’s right to agree to any amendment, supplement, waiver or modification to this Agreement, except for any amendment, supplement, waiver or modification described in Section 13.1(b)(i).

  Section 12.3        Security Interests.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (i) any Purchaser may at any time pledge or grant a security interest in all or any portion of its rights (including, without limitation, any Purchaser Interest and any rights to payment of Capital, Yield or CP Costs and fees) under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Purchaser to a Federal Reserve Bank and (ii) any Company may at any time pledge or grant a security interest in all or any portion of its rights (including, without limitation, any Purchaser Interest and any rights to payment of Capital and CP Costs) under this Agreement to a collateral trustee in order to comply with Rule 3a‑7 under the Investment Company Act, in each case without notice to or consent of any Seller Party, the Agent or any other Purchaser; provided that no such pledge or grant of a security interest shall release a Purchaser from any of its obligations hereunder, or substitute any such pledgee or grantee for such Purchaser as a party hereto.
Section 12.4        Defaulting Purchasers.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, the Agent shall not be obligated to transfer to a Defaulting Purchaser any payments made by the Seller for such Defaulting Purchaser’s benefit or any proceeds of Collateral that would otherwise be remitted hereunder for the account of such Defaulting Purchaser, and, in the absence of such transfer for the account of the Defaulting Purchaser, the Agent shall transfer any such payments (A) first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Purchaser to the Agent hereunder; (B) second, to repay the Agent any amounts funded in respect of such Defaulting Purchaser, together with any accrued and unpaid CP Costs or Yield thereon; (C) third, as the Seller may request (so long as no Amortization Event or Potential Amortization Event shall have occurred and be continuing), to the funding of any Incremental Purchase in respect of which such Defaulting Purchaser has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Agent;  (D) fourth, if so determined by the Agent and the Seller (so long as no Amortization Event or Potential Amortization Event shall have occurred and be continuing), to be held in a separately established deposit account subject to the control of the Agent, and released from time to time in order to satisfy such Defaulting Purchaser’s potential future funding obligations with respect to Incremental Purchases under this Agreement; (E) fifth, so long as no Amortization Event or Potential Amortization Event shall have occurred and be continuing, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Seller as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Seller against such Defaulting Purchaser as a result of such Defaulting Purchaser’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and (F) sixth, to such Defaulting Purchaser or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Capital outstanding in respect of any such Incremental Purchases, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the outstanding Capital of all Non-Defaulting Purchasers, on a pro rata basis, prior to being applied to the payment of any outstanding Capital of such Defaulting Purchaser until such time as all outstanding Capital is held by the Purchasers pro rata in accordance with the applicable Commitments.  Solely for the purposes of voting or consenting to matters with respect to the Transaction Documents (including the calculation of Pro Rata Share in connection therewith) and for the purpose of calculating the fee (other than the Used Fee) payable under clause (i) of Section 2.1, such Defaulting Purchaser shall be deemed not to be a “Purchaser” and such Purchaser’s Commitment shall be deemed to be zero; provided, that the foregoing shall not apply to any of the matters governed by clauses (A) or (B) of Section 13.1(b)(i).  The provisions of this Section 12.4 shall remain effective with respect to such Defaulting Purchaser until the earlier of (y) the date on which all of the Non-Defaulting Purchasers, the Agent and the Seller shall have waived, in writing, the application of this Section 12.4 to such Defaulting Purchaser, or (z) the date on which such Defaulting Purchaser makes payment of all amounts that it was obligated to fund hereunder, pays to the Agent all amounts owing by such Defaulting Purchaser in respect of the amounts that it was obligated to fund hereunder and, if requested by the Agent, provides adequate assurance of its ability to perform its future obligations hereunder.  The operation of this Section 12.4 shall not be construed to increase or otherwise affect the Commitment of any Purchaser, to relieve or excuse the performance by such Defaulting Purchaser or any other Purchaser of its duties and obligations hereunder, or to relieve or excuse the performance by any Seller Party of its duties and obligations hereunder to the Agent or to the Purchasers other than to such Defaulting Purchaser.  Any failure by a Defaulting Purchaser to fund amounts that it was obligated to fund hereunder shall constitute a material breach by such Defaulting Purchaser of this Agreement and shall entitle Seller, at its option, upon written notice to the Agent, to arrange for a substitute Purchaser Group to assume the Commitment of such Defaulting Purchaser’s Purchaser Group, such substitute Purchaser Group to be reasonably acceptable to the Agent.  In connection with the arrangement of such a substitute Purchaser Group,  (i) the Defaulting Purchaser’s Purchaser Group shall have no right to refuse to be replaced hereunder and (ii) the Company in the Defaulting Purchaser’s Purchaser Group shall have no right to consent to the assignment in respect of such Defaulting Purchaser.  In such circumstance, the Defaulting Purchaser’s Purchaser Group agrees to execute and deliver a completed Assignment Agreement in favor of the substitute Purchaser (and agrees that it shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such documentation if it fails

  to do so), subject only in each case to being paid its share of the outstanding Obligations (but not any fee (other than the Used Fee) payable under clause (i) of Section 2.1 during such time as the Purchaser was a Defaulting Purchaser);  provided, that any such assumption of the Commitment of such Defaulting Purchaser shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any of the other Purchasers’ or any Seller Party’s rights or remedies against any such Defaulting Purchaser arising out of or in relation to such failure to fund.  In the event of a direct conflict between the priority provisions of this Section 12.4 and any other provision contained in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, it is the intention of the parties hereto that such provisions be read together and construed, to the fullest extent possible, to be in concert with each other.  In the event of any actual, irreconcilable conflict that cannot be resolved as aforesaid, the terms and provisions of this Section 12.4  shall control and govern.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) without the consent of the Financial Institutions, but with the consent of Seller, the Agent may amend this Agreement solely to add additional Persons as Financial Institutions hereunder and (ii) the Agent, the Required Purchasers and each Company may enter into amendments to modify any of the terms or provisions of Article XI,  Section 13.13 or any other provision of this Agreement without the consent of Seller, provided that such amendment has no negative impact upon Seller and the Agent promptly notifies Seller of such amendment.  Any modification or waiver made in accordance with this Section 13.1 shall apply to each of the Purchasers equally and shall be binding upon Seller, the Purchasers and the Agent.
Section 13.2        Notices.  Except as provided in this Section 13.2,  all communications and notices provided for hereunder shall be in writing (including bank wire, telecopy or other electronic transmission or similar writing) and shall be given to the other parties hereto at their respective addresses or telecopy  numbers or using any other method of electronic transmission set forth on the signature pages hereof or at such other address or telecopy number or using any other method of electronic transmission as such Person may hereafter specify for the purpose of notice to each of the other parties hereto.  Each such notice or other communication shall be effective (i) if given by telecopy or other electronic transmission, upon the receipt thereof, (ii) if given by mail, three Business Days after the time such communication is deposited in the mail with first class postage prepaid or (iii) if given by any other means, when received at the address specified in this Section 13.2.  Seller hereby authorizes the Agent and the Purchasers to effect purchases and selections of Discount Rates based on telephonic notices made by any Person whom the Agent or applicable Purchaser in good faith believes to be acting on behalf of Seller.  Seller agrees to deliver promptly to the Agent and each applicable Purchaser a written confirmation of each telephonic notice signed by an authorized officer of Seller; provided,  however, the absence of such confirmation shall not affect the validity of such notice.  If the written confirmation differs from the action taken by the Agent or applicable Purchaser, the records of the Agent or applicable Purchaser shall govern absent manifest error.
Section 13.3        Ratable Payments.  If any Purchaser, whether by setoff or otherwise, has payment made to it with respect to any portion of the Aggregate Unpaids owing to such Purchaser (other than payments received pursuant to Section 10.2 or 10.3) in a greater proportion than that received by any other Purchaser entitled to receive a ratable share of such Aggregate Unpaids, such Purchaser agrees, promptly upon demand, to purchase for cash without recourse or warranty a portion of such Aggregate Unpaids held by the other Purchasers so that after such purchase each Purchaser will hold its ratable proportion of such Aggregate Unpaids; provided that if all or any portion of such excess amount is thereafter recovered from such Purchaser, such purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.
Section 13.4        Protection of Interests of the Purchasers. (a) Seller agrees that from time to time, at its expense, it will promptly execute and deliver all instruments and documents, and take all actions, that may be necessary or desirable, or that the Agent may request, to perfect, protect or more fully evidence the Purchaser Interests, or to enable the Agent or the Purchasers to exercise and enforce their rights and remedies hereunder.  Without limiting the foregoing, Seller will, upon the request of the Agent, file such financing or continuation statements, or amendments thereto or assignments thereof, and execute and file such other instruments and documents, that may be necessary or desirable, or that the Agent may reasonably request, to perfect, protect or evidence such Purchaser Interest.  At any time after an Amortization Event or Potential Amortization Event shall have occurred and be continuing, the Agent may, or the Agent may direct Seller or the Servicer to, notify the Obligor of Receivables, at Seller’s expense, of the ownership or security interests of the Purchasers under this Agreement and may also direct that payments of all amounts due or that become due under any or all Receivables be made directly to the Agent or its designee.  Seller or the Servicer (as applicable) shall, at any Purchaser’s request, withhold the identity of such Purchaser in any such notification.
(b)        If any Seller Party fails to perform any of its obligations hereunder, the Agent or any Purchaser may (but shall not be required to) perform, or cause performance of, such obligations, and the Agent’s or such Purchaser’s costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by Seller as provided in Section 10.3.  Each Seller Party irrevocably authorizes the Agent at any time and from time to time after the occurrence of any Amortization Event in the sole discretion of the Agent, and appoints the Agent as its attorney-in-fact, to act on behalf of such Seller Party (i) to authorize on behalf of such Seller Party as debtor and to file financing or continuation

Such financing statements may describe the Collateral in the same manner as described herein or may contain an indication or description of collateral that describes the Collateral (which may describe the Collateral as set forth in Exhibit XI) as the Agent may determine, in its sole discretion, is reasonably necessary or advisable to ensure the perfection of the security interest in the Collateral granted to the Agent in connection herewith.  This appointment is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable.  The authorization by each Seller Party set forth above is intended to meet all requirements for authorization by a debtor under Article 9 of any applicable enactment of the UCC, including,  without limitation,  Section 9‑509 thereof.
Section 13.5        Confidentiality.

Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, each Seller Party, each Purchaser, the Agent, each Indemnified Party and any successor or assign of any of the foregoing (and each employee, representative or other agent of any of the foregoing) may disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the “tax treatment” and “tax structure” (in each case, within the meaning of U.S. Treasury Regulation § 1.6011‑4) of the transactions contemplated herein and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are or have been provided to any of the foregoing relating to such tax treatment or tax structure, and it is hereby confirmed that each of the foregoing have been so authorized since the commencement of discussions regarding the transactions.

The Agent or the Purchaser, as applicable, will make reasonable efforts to enter into a confidentiality agreement, reasonably acceptable to the Servicer, with each rating agency hired by such Person and to which it is disclosing information pursuant to clause (iii) or (iv) above; provided, that the absence of such a confidentiality agreement shall not be construed to prohibit the Agent or any Purchaser from making disclosures to any rating agency as may be required by applicable law, rule or regulation (including, for this purpose, any requirements of Rule 17g‑5 or any good faith interpretation thereof).  In addition, the Purchasers and the Agent may disclose any such nonpublic information pursuant to any law, rule, regulation, direction, request or order of any judicial, administrative or regulatory authority or proceedings (whether or not having the force or effect of law) or otherwise with the consent of the applicable Seller Party or Seller Parties.  Except as provided in this clause (b) above, the Agent and the Purchasers shall maintain and shall cause each of its employees and officers to maintain the confidentiality of any confidential or proprietary information with respect to the Seller Parties obtained by it or them in connection with the structuring, negotiating and execution of the transactions contemplated herein.

Any amount which such CP Company does not pay pursuant to the operation of the preceding sentence shall not constitute a claim (as defined in §101 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code) against or corporate obligation of such CP Company for any such insufficiency unless and until such CP Company satisfies the provisions of clauses (i) and (ii) above.  This paragraph (b) shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

Section 13.12        Counterparts; Severability; Section References.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which when taken together shall constitute one and the same Agreement.  Any provisions of this Agreement which are prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.  Unless otherwise expressly indicated, all references herein to “Article,” “Section,” “Schedule” or “Exhibit” shall mean articles and sections of, and schedules and exhibits to, this Agreement.

Section 13.14        Characterization. (a) It is the intention of the parties hereto that each purchase hereunder shall constitute and be treated as an absolute and irrevocable sale, which purchase shall provide the applicable Purchaser with the full benefits of ownership of the applicable Purchaser Interest.  Except as specifically provided in this Agreement, each sale of a Purchaser Interest hereunder is made without recourse to Seller; provided,  however, that (i) Seller shall be liable to each Purchaser and the Agent for all representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities made by Seller pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and (ii) such sale does not constitute and is not intended to result in an assumption by any Purchaser or the Agent or any assignee thereof of any obligation of Seller or Originator or any other Person arising in connection with the Receivables, the Related Security, or the related Contracts, or any other obligations of Seller or Originator.
(b)       In addition to any ownership interest which the Agent may from time to time acquire pursuant hereto, Seller (i) reaffirms its prior grant of a duly perfected security interest to the Agent pursuant to the Existing Agreement and (ii) hereby grants to the Agent for the ratable benefit of the Purchasers a valid and continuing security interest in all of Seller’s right, title and interest in, to and under all Receivables now existing or hereafter arising, the Collections, each Lock-Box, each Collection Account, all Related Security, all other rights and payments relating to such Receivables, and all proceeds of any thereof (collectively, the “Collateral”) prior to all other liens on and security interests therein to secure the prompt and complete payment of the Aggregate Unpaids.  The Agent and the Purchasers shall have, in addition to the rights and remedies that they may have under this Agreement, all other rights and remedies provided to a secured creditor under the UCC (or any comparable law) and other applicable law, which rights and remedies shall be cumulative. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that the security interest and liens granted in the Collateral under and pursuant to the Existing Agreement shall continue in full force and effect, and this Section 13.14(b) shall be deemed to be a continuation and reaffirmation,

  and not a replacement or novation, of the security interest and liens granted under and pursuant to the Existing Agreement.
(c)       If, notwithstanding the intention of the parties expressed above, any sale or transfer by Seller hereunder shall be characterized as a secured loan and not a sale or such sale shall for any reason be ineffective or unenforceable (any of the foregoing being a “Recharacterization”), then this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a security agreement under the UCC and other applicable law.  In the case of any Recharacterization, Seller represents and warrants that each remittance of Collections to the Agent or the Purchasers hereunder will have been (i) in payment of a debt incurred in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs and (ii) made in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs.
Section 13.15        Confirmation and Ratification of Terms. (a) Upon the effectiveness of this Agreement,  each reference to the Existing Agreement in any other Transaction Document, and any document, instrument or agreement executed and/or delivered in connection with the Existing Agreement or any other Transaction Document, shall mean and be a reference to this Agreement.
(b)        The effect of this Agreement is to amend and restate the Existing Agreement in its entirety, and to the extent that any rights, benefits or provisions in favor of the Agent or any Purchaser existed in the Existing Agreement and continue to exist in this Agreement without any written waiver of any such rights, benefits or provisions prior to the Amendment Date, then such rights, benefits or provisions are acknowledged to be and to continue to be effective.  This Agreement is not a novation.

    EXHIBIT IX
FORM OF CONTRACT(S)
Terms and Conditions of Sale
The sale of products and services ("Products") by Avnet, Inc. and its divisions, subsidiaries, and affiliates ("Avnet") to a customer (“Customer”) are subject to these terms and conditions ("Agreement") regardless of other terms or conditions in any purchase order, document, or other communication of Customer ("Order") or Avnet’s failure to object to such other terms. This Agreement may only be modified in writing signed by authorized representatives of both Avnet and Customer.
1.            ORDERS. Unless otherwise stated on the quote, Avnet quotes are invitations to tender and are subject to change at any time without notice. All Orders are subject to acceptance by Avnet. Contracts between Customer and Avnet are formed upon Avnet's written acceptance, Electronic Data Interchange (“EDI”) acknowledgment or execution of Customer's Order and are subject to this Agreement. All Orders for Products that Avnet identifies as non-standard or "NCNR" are non-cancelable and non-returnable. Avnet may identify Products as non-standard or "NCNR" by various means including quotes, Products lists, attachments or exhibits. Customer may not change, cancel or reschedule Orders for standard Products without Avnet's consent. Avnet reserves the right to allocate the sale of Products among its Customers.
2.            PRICES. Unless otherwise stated on Avnet’s proposal, quote or invoice, prices are for Products only and do not include taxes, freight, duties or any other charges or fees for additional services (collectively, “Additional Fees”). Unless otherwise stated on Avnet’s proposal, quote or invoice, Customer is responsible for any and all Additional Fees.
3.            TERMS OF PAYMENT. Payment is due as stated on Avnet’s invoice without offset or any deduction for withholding taxes or otherwise. On any past due invoice, Avnet may charge interest from the payment due date to the date of payment at 18% per annum or the maximum amount allowed by applicable law, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees and collection costs, with a minimum fee of 40 Euros for sales in France. At any time, Avnet may change the terms of Customer's credit. Avnet may apply payments to any of Customer's accounts. If Customer defaults on any payment, Avnet may reschedule or cancel any outstanding delivery or Order and declare all outstanding invoices due and payable immediately. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, Customer credits provided by Avnet will expire if unused within 12 months.
4.            DELIVERY. Unless otherwise stated by Avnet in writing, all Avnet deliveries from the European Union are CPT customer’s delivery location, and all Avnet deliveries from outside the European Union are EXW Avnet's warehouse or, for drop shipments, EXW the manufacturer’s warehouse (INCOTERMS 2010). Avnet's delivery dates are estimates only and subject to Avnet’s timely receipt of supplies. Avnet is not liable for delays in delivery, for partial or early deliveries and Customer shall accept delivery. Customer may not cancel any other Orders based on delayed delivery of any part of an Order.
5.            TITLE. For sales from outside the European Union or Australia, title shall pass to Customer upon delivery of the Products to the carrier. For sales from the European Union or Australia, as a form of payment security, title shall pass to Customer upon payment in full for the Product by Customer. In case of an onwards sale, Customer assigns all rights in the related receivables to Avnet until Customer has made payment in full. Once the Product is processed or combined with other items (the “Processed Product”), Avnet’s retained title transfers to a share in the title in the Processed Product reflecting the value of the Product relative to the value of the Processed Product. This section does not apply to sales of Software (as defined below).
6.            SOFTWARE. Software is the machine readable (object code) version of computer programs (“Software”). Customer’s use of Software and any related documentation shall be governed by the Software’s applicable license agreements. Software embedded in or bundled with hardware must be used solely with the device for which it was intended and may not be transferred separately.
Exh IX-1
    7.            WARRANTY. Customer acknowledges that Avnet is not the manufacturer of the Products. To the extent legally and contractually permitted, Avnet shall pass through to Customer any transferable Product warranties, indemnities, and remedies provided to Avnet by the manufacturer, including those for intellectual property infringement. If required by law, Avnet warrants that at the time of delivery, Products will conform to the specifications stated by the manufacturer in its published data sheet for the Products. All warranty claims shall be time-barred 12 months from the time of delivery of the non-conforming Products. If Avnet performs value-added work such as integration work, tape-and-reel, or programming, Avnet warrants such value-add work will conform to Customer’s written specifications accepted by Avnet for 90 days after Avnet delivery. Customer will be deemed the manufacturer of such value-added Products. AVNET MAKES NO OTHER WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, SUCH AS WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. Customer’s sole remedies for breach of Avnet’s warranty are, at Avnet’s choice: (i) repair of the Products; (ii) replacement of the Products; or (iii) refund of Customer’s purchase price for the Products. Avnet makes no representation or warranty with respect to Software and will have no liability in connection therewith. Unless it is specifically stated in the Software’s applicable license agreement, SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITH NO ADDITIONAL WARRANTY.
8.            PRODUCT RETURN. Customer may return Products to Avnet only with a return material authorization (“RMA”) number issued by Avnet. (A) Returns for Visual Defect: Customer must notify Avnet in writing of any damage to the outer packaging or the Products, shortage, or other discrepancy (“Visual Defect”) within three business days after receipt of the shipment; otherwise, Customer is deemed to have accepted the Products. (B) Returns for Product Warranty: Customer must notify Avnet in writing stating the specific Product defect within the warranty period. Avnet will only issue an RMA if the defect (either for Visual Defect or for Product Warranty) is created solely by Avnet or the original manufacturer, and only if Customer meets the notice requirement. Avnet will not grant RMAs for damage, shortage, or other discrepancy created by Customer, the carrier or freight provider, or any other third party. Upon receiving the RMA, Customer must return the Products to Avnet in compliance with Avnet’s instructions in the RMA. Avnet may assess all Products returned by Customer via RMA. If Avnet determines such Products are not eligible for return, Avnet will send such Products back to Customer on freight collect basis, or hold such Products for Customer’s collection and on account at Customer’s expense.
9.            LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Avnet’s liability to Customer is limited to Customer’s direct damages up to an amount not exceeding the price of the Product at issue. This limitation of liability does not apply in case of death or personal injury caused by Avnet’s negligence. Avnet is not liable for and Customer is not entitled to any indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages (for example, loss of profits or revenue, loss of data, loss of use, rework, repair, manufacturing expense, costs of product recall, injury to reputation or loss of customers). To the extent Avnet cannot lawfully disclaim any implied or statutory warranties, Customer’s statutory rights are not affected by this limitation of liability.
10.          FORCES BEYOND AVNET'S CONTROL. Avnet is not liable for failure to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement due to causes beyond its reasonable control (for example, acts of nature, acts or omissions of Customer, operational disruptions, man-made or natural disasters, epidemic medical crises, materials or Product shortages, strikes, criminal acts, delays in delivery or transportation, or inability to obtain labor, materials or Products through regular sources).
11.          USE OF PRODUCTS. Customer shall comply with the manufacturer's Product specifications. Products are not authorized for use in life support systems, human implantation, nuclear facilities or any other application where Product failure could lead to loss of life or property damage. If Customer uses or sells the Products for use in such applications or fails to comply with the manufacturer's Product specifications, Customer acknowledges that such use, sale, or non-compliance is at Customer's sole risk. Customer shall indemnify, defend and hold Avnet harmless from any claims based on: (i) Avnet's compliance with Customer's designs, specifications, or instructions, (ii) modification of any Product by anyone other than Avnet, or (iii) use of Products in combination with other products or in violation of this clause.
Exh IX-2
    12.          EXPORT/IMPORT. Certain Products and related technology sold by Avnet are subject to export control regulations of the United States, the European Union, and/or other countries, excluding boycott laws ("Export Laws"). Customer shall comply with such Export Laws and obtain any license or permit required to transfer, export, re-export or import the Products and related technology. Customer shall not export or re-export the Products and related technology to any country or entity to which such export or re-export is prohibited, including any country or entity under sanction or embargoes administered by the United States, European Union or other countries. Customer shall not use the Products and related technology in relation to chemical, biological or nuclear weapons, rocket systems (including ballistic missile systems, space launch vehicles and sounding rockets) or unmanned air vehicles capable of delivering same, or in the development of any weapons of mass destruction.
13.          ELECTRONIC ORDERS. If any part of the purchase and sale of Products, including Customer's NCNR acknowledgment or demand forecast, uses EDI, Customer's internal portal, third party portal or any other electronic means ("Electronic Purchase Order"), this Agreement will continue to apply to the purchase and sale of Products between Customer and Avnet. Customer's acceptance of Avnet's acknowledgment request or Avnet's specification of details with respect to Electronic Purchase Orders via writing, email or other EDI is binding on Customer.
14.          ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE. Where applicable, Customer is responsible for all obligations and liabilities under the European Union’s (i) Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (2012/19/EU), (ii) Packaging Waste Directive (94/62/EC) and (iii) Batteries Directive (2006/66/EC), all as amended and all related national implementing measures in force from time to time.
15.          GENERAL.
A.           This Agreement shall be governed, construed, and enforced in accordance with the laws of the country where the Avnet entity that accepted Customer's Order ("Governing Country") is located without reference to the conflict of laws principles. If the Governing Country is the United States of America, the laws and courts of the State of Arizona will apply. The United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply.  The courts of the Governing Country shall have jurisdiction and venue over all controversies arising out of, or relating to, this Agreement.
B.           Customer may not assign this Agreement without Avnet’s prior written consent. Avnet's affiliates may perform Avnet's obligations under this Agreement. This Agreement is binding on successors and assigns.

    G.           Product information (for example, statements or advice (technical or otherwise) advertisement content, and information related to a Product's specifications, features, export/import control classifications, uses or conformance with legal or other requirements) is provided by Avnet on an "AS IS" basis and does not form a part of the properties of the Product. Avnet makes no representation as to the accuracy or completeness of the Product information, and DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND LIABILITIES UNDER ANY THEORY WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCT INFORMATION. Avnet recommends Customer validate any Product Information before using or acting on such information. All Product information is subject to change without notice. Avnet is not responsible for typographical or other errors or omissions in Product information.
16.          GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. Avnet is a distributor of "Commercial Items" as defined in FAR 2.101. Avnet does not intend to sell Products to the U.S. Government or a higher-tier contractor that fail to meet the “commercial item” definition in FAR 2.101. Accordingly, Avnet agrees only to the clauses in the Federal Acquisition Regulation ("FAR") and agency FAR supplements (as applicable based on the U.S. Government customer) that are explicitly required to be inserted in a subcontract for commercial items, as set forth in FAR 52.244-6(c)(1) or an agency FAR supplement. In accordance with FAR 12.211, Customer will receive only those rights in technical data customarily provided to Avnet by the manufacturers. By no means will this be interpreted as providing to Customer unlimited rights in data, software, or intellectual property rights provided by the manufacturers or any other third party. Avnet specifically rejects the flow down of the requirements of the: (i) Trade Agreements Act, FAR 52.225-5 or DFARS 252.225-7021; and (ii) the Buy American Act, FAR 52.225-1 or DFARS 252.225-7001. Avnet cannot comply with any Preference for Domestic Specialty Metals regulation unless (A) there is an applicable exception or (B) the manufacturer represents and warrants that the Products are compliant.
