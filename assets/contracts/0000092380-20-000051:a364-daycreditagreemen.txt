Notwithstanding the foregoing, the determination of income before income taxes for any period shall be adjusted by any pre-tax non-GAAP financial measures for such period as identified in “Reconciliation of Reported Amounts to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” contained in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company’s filings in respect of such period on Form 10-Q or Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

to the LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Loan plus the Applicable Rate. Interest on each Eurodollar Loan shall be payable on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto. The applicable LIBO Rate for each Interest Period shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(b)    Subject to the provisions of Section 2.9, each Alternate Base Loan shall bear interest at the rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate (if the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate, computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be; if the Alternate Base Rate is based on the LIBO Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate, computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days). Interest on each Alternate Base Loan shall be payable on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto. The applicable Alternate Base Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
Section 2.9     Interest on Overdue Amounts. If the Company shall default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Loan or any other amount becoming due hereunder, the Company shall on demand from time to time pay interest, to the extent permitted by Law, on such defaulted amount up to (but not including) the date of actual payment (after as well as before judgment) at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of the principal amount of any Eurodollar Loan, 2% above the rate otherwise applicable thereto and (ii) in all other cases, the Agreed Maximum Rate (if the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate, computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be; if the Alternate Base Rate is based on the LIBO Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate, computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days).
Section 2.10     Alternate Rate of Interest. (a) If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:
(i)
Subject to clause (b) below, the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable (including because the Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis), for dollars such Interest Period; or
(ii)
the Administrative Agent is advised by the Majority Banks that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for dollars and such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks (or Bank) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for dollars and such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Company and the Banks by telephone, telecopy or electronic mail as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Company and the Banks that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, any interest election request pursuant to Section 2.3 that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective; provided that if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowings, then the other Type of Borrowings shall be permitted.
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Paper, upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, the Administrative Agent and the Company may amend this Agreement to replace the LIBO Rate with a Benchmark Replacement. Any such amendment with respect to a Benchmark Transition Event will become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Administrative Agent has posted such proposed amendment to all Banks

19



and the Company, so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such proposed amendment from Banks comprising the Majority Banks; provided that, with respect to any such proposed amendment containing any SOFR-Based Rate, the Banks shall be entitled to object only to the Benchmark Replacement Adjustment contained therein. Any such amendment with respect to an Early Opt-in Election will become effective on the date that Banks comprising the Majority Banks have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Majority Banks accept such amendment. No replacement of LIBO Rate with a Benchmark Replacement will occur prior to the applicable Benchmark Transition Start Date.
(c) In connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Paper, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement.
(d) The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Company and the Banks of (i) any occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (iii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes and (iv) the commencement or conclusion of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or Banks pursuant to this Section 2.10, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party hereto, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.10.
(e) Upon the Company’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, any interest election request pursuant to Section 2.3 that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective.
Section 2.11     Prepayment of Loans
(a)    After the date that is 90 days after the Effective Date, the Company shall have the right at any time to prepay the Loans, in whole or in part, subject to the requirements of Section 2.14 or Section 2.15 but otherwise without premium or penalty, upon at least five Business Days prior written notice to the Administrative Agent; provided, however, that each such partial prepayment shall be in an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and in a minimum aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000. Each notice of prepayment shall specify the prepayment date and the aggregate principal amount of each Borrowing to be prepaid, shall be irrevocable and shall commit the Company to prepay such Borrowing by the amount stated therein.
(b)    [reserved].
(c)    All prepayments under this Section 2.11 shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the principal amount being prepaid to the date of prepayment. Amounts prepaid pursuant to this Section 2.11 may not be reborrowed.
Section 2.12     Reserve Requirements; Change in Circumstances
(a)    Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if after the date of this Agreement any Regulatory Change or change in any Law (i) shall subject the Administrative Agent or a Bank to any Taxes (other than (w) Indemnified Taxes, (x) Taxes described in clauses (c) and (e) of Excluded Taxes, (y) Other

20



Taxes and (z) Other Connection Taxes imposed on or measured by net income (however denominated) or that are franchise Taxes or branch profits Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto, (ii) shall impose, modify, or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement with respect to any Eurodollar Loan against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, such Bank under this Agreement, or (iii) with respect to any Eurodollar Loan, shall impose on such Bank or the Eurodollar Interbank Market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or any Eurodollar Loan made by such Bank, and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to materially increase the actual cost to such Bank (or such Administrative Agent in the case of (i)) of maintaining its Commitment or of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan or to materially reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or such Administrative Agent in the case of (i)) hereunder (whether of principal, interest, or otherwise) in respect thereof, then the Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank (or such Administrative Agent in the case of (i)), within ten days following delivery to the Company of the certificate specified in paragraph (c) below by such Bank (or such Administrative Agent in the case of (i)), such additional amount or amounts as will reimburse such Bank (or such Administrative Agent in the case of (i)) for such increase or reduction to such Bank (or such Administrative Agent in the case of (i)) to the extent reasonably allocable to this Agreement.
(b)    If any Bank shall have determined in good faith that any Regulatory Change regarding capital or liquidity requirements or compliance by any Bank (or its parent or any lending office of such Bank) with any request or directive issued subsequent to the Effective Date regarding capital or liquidity requirements (whether or not having the force of Law) of any Tribunal, monetary authority, central bank, or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Bank’s (or its parent’s) capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Bank (or its parent) could have achieved but for such Regulatory Change, or compliance (taking into consideration such Bank’s policies with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then from time to time, the Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank, within ten days following delivery to the Company of the certificate specified in paragraph (d) below by such Bank, such additional amount or amounts as will reimburse such Bank (or its parent) for such reduction.
(c)    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) all requests, rules, guidelines, requirements and directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or by United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, and (ii) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines, requirements and directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith or in implementation thereof, shall in each case be deemed to be a Regulatory Change and a change in Law, regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued.
(d)    Each Bank or the Administrative Agent shall notify the Company of any event occurring after the date hereof entitling such Bank to compensation under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 2.12 (together with a good faith estimate of the amounts it would be entitled to claim in respect of such event) as promptly as practicable, but in any event on or before the date which is 60 days after the related Regulatory Change, change in any Law or other event; provided that (i) if such Bank or the Administrative Agent fails to give such notice by such date, such Bank or the Administrative Agent shall, with respect to compensation payable pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 2.12 in respect of any costs resulting from such Regulatory Change, change in any Law or other event, only be entitled to payment under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 2.12 for costs incurred from and after the date of such notice and (ii) such Bank or the Administrative Agent will take such reasonable actions, if any (including the designation of a different Applicable Lending Office for the Loans of such Bank affected by such event) to avoid the need for, or

21



reduce the amount of, such compensation so long as such actions will not, in the reasonable opinion of such Bank or the Administrative Agent, be materially disadvantageous to such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be. A certificate of a Bank or the Administrative Agent setting forth in reasonable detail (i) the Regulatory Change, change in any Law or other event giving rise to any costs, (ii) such amount or amounts as shall be necessary to reimburse such Bank or the Administrative Agent as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 2.12, as the case may be, and (iii) the calculation of such amount or amounts, shall be delivered to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) promptly after such Bank or the Administrative Agent determines it is entitled to payment under this Section 2.12, and shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error. In preparing such certificate, such Bank or the Administrative Agent may employ such assumptions and allocations of costs and expenses as it shall in good faith deem reasonable and may use any reasonable averaging and attribution method.
(e)    In the event any Bank shall seek payment pursuant to this Section 2.12 or the events contemplated under Section 2.10 or Section 2.13 shall have occurred with respect to any Bank, the Company shall have the right to replace such Bank with, and add as “Banks” under this Agreement in place thereof, one or more assignees as provided in Section 2.23(b).
(f)    Without prejudice to the survival of any other obligations of the Company hereunder, the obligations of the Company under this Section 2.12 shall survive for one year after the termination of this Agreement and/or the payment or assignment of any of the Loans or Notes.
Section 2.13     Change in Legality
(a)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, if any Regulatory Change shall make it unlawful for any Bank to make or maintain any Eurodollar Loan or to give effect to its obligations in respect of Eurodollar Loans as contemplated hereby, then, by prompt written notice to the Company and to the Administrative Agent, such Bank may:
(i)    declare that Eurodollar Loans will not thereafter be made by such Bank hereunder, whereupon the Company shall be prohibited from requesting Eurodollar Loans from such Bank hereunder unless such declaration is subsequently withdrawn; and
(ii)    if such unlawfulness shall be effective prior to the end of any Interest Period of an outstanding Eurodollar Loan, require that all outstanding Eurodollar Loans with such Interest Periods made by it be converted to Alternate Base Loans, in which event (A) all such Eurodollar Loans shall be automatically converted to Alternate Base Loans as of the effective date of such notice as provided in paragraph (b) below and (B) all payments and prepayments of principal which would otherwise have been applied to repay the converted Eurodollar Loans shall instead be applied to repay the Alternate Base Loans resulting from the conversion of such Eurodollar Loans.
(b)    For purposes of this Section 2.13, a notice to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) by any Bank pursuant to paragraph (a) above shall be effective on the date of receipt thereof by the Company. Any Bank having furnished such a notice agrees to withdraw the same promptly following any Regulatory Change that makes it lawful for such Bank to make and maintain Eurodollar Loans.
(c)    If, with respect to any Bank, a condition arises or an event occurs which would, or would upon the giving of notice, result in the payment of amounts pursuant to Section 2.12 or permit such Bank, pursuant to this Section 2.13, to suspend its obligation to make Eurodollar Loans, such Bank, promptly upon becoming aware of the same, shall notify the Company thereof and shall take such steps as may reasonably

22



be available to it (including, without limitation, changing its Applicable Lending Office) to mitigate the effects of such condition or event, provided that such Bank shall be under no obligation to take any step that, in its good faith opinion, would (a) result in its incurring any additional costs in performing its obligations hereunder and under any outstanding Loan (unless the Company has notified such Bank of the Company’s agreement to reimburse it for the same) or (b) be otherwise adverse to such Bank in a material respect.
Section 2.14     Indemnity. The Company shall indemnify each Bank against any loss or reasonable expense which such Bank may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) any failure by the Company to fulfill on the Effective Date the applicable conditions set forth in Article IV, (b) any failure by the Company to borrow hereunder after a Notice of Committed Borrowing pursuant to Article II has been given, (c) any payment, prepayment, or conversion of a Eurodollar Loan required by any other provision of this Agreement or otherwise made on a date other than the last day of the applicable Interest Period for any reason, including without limitation the acceleration of outstanding Loans as a result of any Event of Default or (d) any failure by the Company for any reason (including without limitation the existence of a Default or an Event of Default) to pay, prepay or convert a Eurodollar Loan on the date for such payment, prepayment or conversion, specified in the relevant notice of payment, prepayment or conversion under this Agreement. The indemnity of the Company pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall include, but not be limited to, any loss or reasonable expense sustained or incurred or to be sustained or incurred in liquidating or employing deposits from third parties acquired to effect or maintain such Loan or any part thereof as a Eurodollar Loan. Such loss or reasonable expense shall include, without limitation, an amount equal to the excess, if any, as reasonably determined by each Bank of (i) its cost of obtaining the funds for the Loan being paid, prepaid, or converted or not borrowed, paid, prepaid or converted (based on the LIBO Rate) for the period from the date of such payment, prepayment, or conversion or failure to borrow, pay, prepay or convert to the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, pay, prepay or convert, the Interest Period for the Loan which would have commenced on the date of such failure to borrow, pay, prepay or convert) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Bank) that would be realized by such Bank in reemploying the funds so paid, prepaid, or converted or not borrowed, paid, prepaid or converted for such period or Interest Period, as the case may be. A certificate of each Bank setting forth any amount or amounts and, in reasonable detail, the computations thereof, which such Bank is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.14 shall be delivered to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) and shall be conclusive, if made in good faith, absent manifest error. The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank the amount shown as due on any certificate within 30 days after its receipt of the same. The obligations of the Company pursuant to this Section 2.14 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and/or the payment or assignment of any of the Loans or Notes.
Section 2.15     Pro Rata Treatment. Except as permitted under Section 2.12(d) and Section 2.14 with respect to interest, (a) each payment or prepayment of principal and each payment of interest with respect to the Loans shall be made pro rata among the Banks in accordance with the respective principal amounts of the Loans extended by each Bank, and (b) conversions of Loans to Loans of another Type, continuations of Loans that are Eurodollar Loans from one Interest Period to another Interest Period, and Loans which are not refinancings of other Loans shall be made pro rata among the Banks in accordance with the Applicable Percentages.
Section 2.16     Sharing of Setoffs. Each Bank agrees that if it shall through the exercise of a right of banker’s lien, setoff, or counterclaim against the Company (pursuant to Section 9.6 or otherwise), including, but not limited to, a secured claim under Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States Code or other security or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such Bank under any applicable Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, obtain payment (voluntary or involuntary) in respect of the Loans held by it (other than pursuant to Section 2.12, or Section 2.14) as a result of which the unpaid principal

23



portion of the Loans held by it shall be proportionately less than the unpaid principal portion of the Loans held by any other Bank, it shall be deemed to have simultaneously purchased from such other Bank a participation in the Loans held by such other Bank, so that the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans and participations in Loans pursuant to this Section 2.16 held by each Bank shall be in the same proportion to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans then outstanding as the principal amount of the Loans held by it prior to such exercise of banker’s lien, setoff, or counterclaim was to the principal amount of all Loans outstanding prior to such exercise of banker’s lien, setoff, or counterclaim; provided, however, that if any such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be made pursuant to this Section 2.16 and the payment giving rise thereto shall thereafter be recovered, such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be rescinded to the extent of such recovery and the purchase price or prices or adjustment restored without interest. The Company expressly consents to the foregoing arrangements and agrees that any Bank holding a participation in a Loan deemed to have been so purchased may exercise any and all rights of banker’s lien, setoff, or counterclaim with respect to any and all moneys owing by the Company to such Bank as fully as if such Bank had made a Loan directly to the Company in the amount of such participation.
Section 2.17     Payments
(a)    The Company shall make each payment hereunder and under any instrument delivered hereunder not later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the day when due in dollars, without setoff or counterclaim, to the Administrative Agent at its Principal Office for the account of the Banks, in federal or other immediately available funds. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal of or interest on Loans (other than pursuant to Section 2.12, and Section 2.14) ratably to the Banks and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Bank to such Bank for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(b)    Whenever any payment hereunder or under any Note shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in all such cases be included in the computation of payment of interest; provided, however, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of a Eurodollar Loan to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.
(c)    Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Company prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that the Company will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Company has made or will make such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank. If and to the extent the Company shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Bank together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
Section 2.18     Taxes. (a) Each payment by the Company under this Agreement or any Loan Papers shall be made without withholding for any Taxes, unless such withholding is required by applicable Law. If any Withholding Agent determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it is so required to withhold Taxes, then such Withholding Agent may so withhold and shall timely pay the full amount of withheld Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law. If such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, then the amount payable by the Company shall be increased as necessary so that, net of such withholding (including such withholding applicable to additional amounts payable under

24



this Section), the amounts received with respect to this Agreement equal the amount which would have received had no such withholding been made.
(b)    The Company shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law.
(c)    As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes by the Company to a Governmental Authority, the Company shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(d)    The Company shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Bank, within 30 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of Indemnified Taxes (including, without limitation, any Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.18) payable or paid by the Administrative Agent or such Bank (or its beneficial owner), as the case may be, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Company by a Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Bank, shall be conclusive, if made in good faith, absent manifest error.
(e)    Each Bank shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Taxes attributable to such Bank that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent, and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority, but only to the extent that the Company has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Company to do so. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Bank by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. For the avoidance of doubt, there shall be no double recovery under this paragraph where the indemnified party has been indemnified for the same loss under a separate provision of the agreement.
(f)     (i) Any Bank that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of any applicable withholding Tax with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Papers shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by Law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Bank, if requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by Law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Company or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Bank is subject to any withholding (including backup withholding) or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such forms (other than such documentation set forth in Sections 2.18(f)(ii)(A) through (E) below or any successor or substantially similar or comparable documentation thereto) shall not be required if in the Bank’s good faith judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Bank to any material unreimbursed cost or expense (or, in the case of a change in Law, any incremental material unreimbursed cost or expense), unless indemnified by the Company in an amount reasonably satisfactory to such Bank, or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Bank. If any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect with respect to a Bank, such Bank shall promptly (and in any event within 10 days after such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy)

25



notify the Company and the Administrative Agent in writing of such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy and update the form or certification if it is legally eligible to do so.
(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any Bank that is not a “United States person” within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a “Foreign Bank”) shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Bank becomes a lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:

(A)    duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States of America is a party;
(B)    duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI;
(C)    in the case of a Foreign Bank claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-1 to the effect that (i) such Foreign Bank is not (A) a “bank” within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a “10 percent shareholder” of the Company within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, and (C) a “controlled foreign corporation” described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code, and (ii) the interest payments in question are not effectively connected with the United States trade or business conducted by such Bank (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable;
(D)    to the extent a Foreign Bank is not the beneficial owner (for example, where the Foreign Bank is a partnership or participating Bank granting a typical participation), an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY, accompanied by a Form W-8ECI, W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-2 or F-3 (as applicable), Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that, if the Foreign Bank is a partnership (and not a participating Bank) and one or more beneficial owners of such Foreign Bank are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Bank may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-4 on behalf of each such beneficial owner; or
(E)    any other form prescribed by Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Law to permit the Company to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.

26




(iii) If a payment made to a Bank under this Agreement or any other Loan Papers would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Bank were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Bank shall deliver to the Withholding Agent, at the time or times prescribed by Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent as may be necessary for the Withholding Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Bank has or has not complied with such Bank’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.18(f)(iii), “FATCA” shall include all amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(g)    If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.18 (including additional amounts paid pursuant to this Section 2.18), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including any Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall promptly repay to such indemnified party the amount paid to such indemnified party pursuant to the previous sentence (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.18(g), in no event will any indemnified party be required to pay any amount to any indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 2.18(g) if such payment would place such indemnified party in a less favorable position (on a net after-Tax basis) than such indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This Section 2.18(g) shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
(h)    The provisions of this Section 2.18 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and/or the payment or assignment of any of the Loans or Notes.
(i)    For purposes of this Section 2.18, the term “Bank” includes the term “applicable Law” includes FATCA.
Section 2.19     Calculation of LIBO Rates. The provisions of this Agreement relating to calculation of the LIBO Rate are included only for the purpose of determining the rate of interest or other amounts to be paid hereunder that are based upon such rate, it being understood that each Bank shall be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all or any part of a Eurodollar Loan as it sees fit. All such determinations hereunder, however, shall be made as if each Bank had actually funded and maintained funding of each Eurodollar Loan through the purchase in the Eurodollar InterBank Market of one or more eurodollar deposits in an amount equal to the principal amount of such Loan and having a maturity corresponding to the Interest Period for such Loan.
Section 2.20     Booking Loans. Subject to Section 2.18, any Bank may make, carry, or, transfer Loans at, to, or for the account of any of its branch offices or the office of any Affiliate.

27



Section 2.21     Quotation of Rates. It is hereby acknowledged that the Company may call the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which notice of a Borrowing, continuation or conversion is to be delivered by the Company in order to receive an indication of the rate or rates then in effect, but that such projection shall not be binding upon the Administrative Agent or any Bank nor affect the rate of interest which thereafter is actually in effect when the election is made.
Section 2.22     Defaulting Banks. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Bank becomes a Defaulting Bank, the Administrative Agent shall deliver written notice to such effect, upon the Administrative Agent’s obtaining knowledge of such event, to the Company and such Defaulting Bank, and the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Bank is a Defaulting Bank:
(a)    The Commitment and outstanding Loans of such Defaulting Bank shall not be included in determining whether all Banks or the Majority Banks have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to Section 9.1), provided that any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Banks or each affected Bank which would increase or extend the term of the Commitment or the Maturity Date of Loans of such Defaulting Bank or which affects such Defaulting Bank differently than other affected Banks shall require the consent of such Defaulting Bank.
(b)    Any amount payable to such Defaulting Bank hereunder (whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise and including any amount that would otherwise be payable to such Defaulting Bank pursuant to Section 2.16, but excluding amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.23) shall, in lieu of being distributed to such Defaulting Bank, subject to any applicable requirements of law, be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent (i) first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Bank to the Administrative Agent hereunder, (ii) second, to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Bank has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent, (iii) third, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Banks as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Bank against such Defaulting Bank as a result of such Defaulting Bank’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement, (iv) fourth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Company as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Company against such Defaulting Bank as a result of such Defaulting Bank’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement, and (v) fifth, to such Defaulting Bank or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction, provided, with respect to this clause (v), that if such payment is (x) a prepayment of the principal amount of any Loans and (y) made at a time when the conditions set forth in clauses (c)-(e) of Section 4.1 are satisfied, such payment shall be applied solely to prepay the Loans of, and reimbursement obligations owed to, all non-Defaulting Banks pro rata prior to being applied to the prepayment of any Loans, or reimbursement obligations owed to, any Defaulting Bank.
In the event that the Administrative Agent and the Company each agrees that a Defaulting Bank has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Bank to be a Defaulting Bank or upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of the confirmation referred to in clause (c) of the definition of “Defaulting Bank”, as applicable, then on such date such Bank shall purchase at par such portion of the Loans of the other Banks as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Bank to hold such Loans ratably in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.
Section 2.23     Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Banks.
(a)    If any Bank requests compensation under Section 2.12 or Section 2.18, or if the Company is required to pay any additional amount to any Bank or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Bank pursuant to Section 2.12 or Section 2.18, then such Bank shall use reasonable efforts to designate a

28



different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Bank, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.12 or Section 2.18 in the future and (ii) would not subject such Bank to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Bank. The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Bank in connection with any such designation or assignment.
(b)    If (i) any Bank requests compensation under Section 2.12 or Section 2.18, (ii) the Company is required to pay any additional amount to any Bank or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Bank pursuant to Section 2.12 or Section 2.18, (iii) an event contemplated under Section 2.10 or Section 2.13 shall have occurred with respect to any Bank or (iv) any Bank becomes a Defaulting Bank, then, in each case, the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Bank and the Administrative Agent, require such Bank to assign and delegate, without recourse (except for certain customary representations and warranties, in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.10), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Bank, if a Bank accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Company shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Bank shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.12 or Section 2.18 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.12 or Section 2.18, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Bank shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Bank or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

Appraised Value of the Pool Assets, based on the most recently delivered Appraisal with respect to assets already constituting Pool Assets and based on an Appraisal performed at (or relatively contemporaneously with) the time of such addition with respect to assets being added to Pool Assets, shall satisfy the Collateral Coverage Test (and Schedule II shall be modified to reflect such addition), provided that (A) at the time of such addition, the Administrative Agent and the Banks shall have received an Officer’s Certificate certifying that the conditions set forth in this Section 6.12 shall have been satisfied after giving effect to such addition and attaching thereto such Appraisal, and (B) the asset being added shall constitute Specified Equipment.
Section 6.13     Restrictions on Liens. (a) The Company will not, nor will it permit any Subsidiary to, create, assume or suffer to exist any Lien upon or with respect to the Pool Assets, or enter into any arrangement with any Person that would materially negatively impact the value of any Pool Asset realizable by any third party or assign any right to receive the proceeds from the sale, transfer or disposition of any of the Pool Assets, or file or authorize the filing with respect to any of the Pool Assets of any financing statement naming the Company or any Subsidiary as debtor under the Uniform Commercial Code or any similar notice of Lien naming the Company or any Subsidiary as debtor under any similar recording or notice statute (including, without limitation, any filing under Title 49, United States Code, Section 44107), other than Permitted Liens affecting Pool Assets.
(b) The Company will not enter into or suffer to exist, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to enter into or suffer to exist, any agreement prohibiting or conditioning the creation or assumption of any first priority Lien upon any Pool Asset to secure Debt or other obligations of the Company or of any Subsidiary of the Company that holds Pool Assets.
Section 6.14     Mergers and Dissolutions. (a) The Company will not merge or consolidate with any other person unless:
(i)no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would result therefrom;
(ii)    the Company is the surviving corporation or, if otherwise, (x) such other Person or continuing corporation (the “Successor Company”) is a corporation or other entity organized under the laws of a state of the United States and (y) such Successor Company is a U.S. certificated air carrier; and
(iii)    in the case of a Successor Company, the Successor Company shall (A) execute, prior to or contemporaneously with the consummation of such transaction, such agreements, if any, as are in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, necessary or advisable to evidence the assumption by the Successor Company of liability for all of the obligations of the Company hereunder and the other Loan Papers, and (B) cause to be delivered to the Administrative Agent and the Banks such legal opinions (which may be from in-house counsel) as any of them may reasonably request in connection with the matters specified in the preceding clause (A) and (C) provide such information as each Bank or the Administrative Agent reasonably requests in order to perform its "know your customer" due diligence with respect to the Successor Company.
Upon any consolidation or merger in accordance with this Section 6.14(a) in any case in which the Company is not the surviving corporation, the Successor Company shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under this Agreement with the same effect as if such Successor Company had been named as the Company herein. No such consolidation or merger shall have the effect of releasing the Company or any Successor Company which shall theretofore

38



have become successor to the Company in the manner prescribed in this Section 6.14(a) from its liability with respect to any Loan Paper to which it is a party.
(b) The Company will not liquidate, wind up, or dissolve itself (or suffer any liquidation or dissolution).
Section 6.15     Assignment. The Company will not assign or transfer any of its Rights, duties, or obligations under any of the Loan Papers to which it is a party.
Section 6.16     Amendments.

ARTICLE VII
EVENTS OF DEFAULT; REMEDIES
Section 7.1     Events of Default. Any one or more of the following events shall be “Events of Default” hereunder (which shall include by definition the expiration of any grace period with respect thereto), whether the same shall occur and be continuing for any reason whatsoever (and whether such occurrence shall be voluntary or involuntary or come about or be effected by operation of Law or otherwise):
(a)    Payment of Obligation. Failure to pay any principal of any Loan when due whether at maturity, by declaration as authorized by this Agreement, or otherwise; or failure to pay, within five Business Days after the due date thereof, any interest on any Loan; or failure to pay, within five Business Days after the due date thereof, or if no due date therefor is herein specified within five Business Days after written demand therefor is given to the Company by the Administrative Agent, any fee or other amount payable by the Company hereunder or under any of the other Loan Papers.
(b)    Covenants. Default shall be made in the observance or performance of any other of the covenants, conditions, and agreements on the part of the Company (or in the case of Section 6.12, on the part of any Subsidiary having any Pool Assets) contained herein, or in any other Loan Papers and such default shall continue for a period of 30 days (or, in the case of Section 6.9, five Business Days) after the Administrative Agent shall have given the Company notice thereof in writing; provided that failure to comply with Section 6.8(b) arising from the failure to deliver the Appraisal on the Appraisal Delivery Date described in clause (a) of the definition of Appraisal Delivery Date shall not be subject to the grace period pursuant to this Section 7.1(b) and constitute an immediate Event of Default.
(c)    Debtor Relief. The Company or any Material Subsidiary shall file a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or a petition or answer seeking reorganization, arrangement, composition, liquidation, receivership, or similar relief under any Debtor Relief Law, or shall file a petition to take advantage of any Debtor Relief Law, or shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or shall admit in writing its inability to pay its debts as they become due, or shall fail generally to pay its debts as they become due, or shall consent to the appointment of any receiver, trustee, custodian or liquidator of it or all or a substantial part of its Property; or a proceeding or action shall be instituted or commenced against the Company or any

39



Material Subsidiary seeking an order for relief or a reorganization, arrangement, composition, liquidation, receivership, or similar relief under any Debtor Relief Law or seeking the appointment, without the consent of the Company or any Material Subsidiary, of any receiver, trustee, custodian or liquidator of it or all or a substantial part of the Property of the Company or any Material Subsidiary and such proceeding or action shall remain undismissed or unstayed for a period of 90 days; or an order, decree, or judgment for an involuntary petition adjudicating the Company or any Subsidiary insolvent shall be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction and shall remain undismissed or unstayed for a period of 90 days.
(d)    Payment of Judgments. The Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries fails to pay any judgment or order for the payment of money in excess of $50,000,000 rendered against it or any of its assets (exclusive of judgment amounts fully covered by insurance where the insurer has admitted liability in respect thereof) and either (i) any enforcement proceedings shall have been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or order or (ii) the same shall not be discharged (or provisions shall not be made for such discharge), or a stay of execution thereof shall not be procured, within 30 days from the date of entry thereof and the Company or the relevant Material Subsidiary shall not, within said period of 30 days, or such longer period during which execution of the same shall have been stayed, appeal therefrom and cause the execution thereof to be stayed during such appeal.
(e)    Default on Other Debt or Security. The Company or any Material Subsidiary shall (i) fail to pay any principal of or interest on any Debt (other than the Obligation) the principal or face amount of which exceeds $50,000,000 when due (or, where permitted, within any applicable grace period), whether by scheduled maturity, required prepayment, acceleration, demand or otherwise and such default continues unremedied for five Business Days after such due date or applicable grace period, or (ii) fail to perform or observe any other provision (other than a provision that is substantially identical to a provision in this Agreement) contained in any agreement securing or relating to such Debt (or any other breach or default under such Debt agreement occurs) if the effect of such failure to perform or observe such other provisions (or breach or default) is to cause such Debt to become due prior to its stated maturity; provided, however, that if any such failure, breach or default shall be waived or cured (as evidenced by a writing from such holder or trustee) then, to the extent of such waiver or cure, the Event of Default hereunder by reason of such failure, breach or default shall be deemed likewise to have been thereupon waived or cured.
(f)    ERISA. Any “Reportable Event” as such term is defined in ERISA under any Plan, or the appointment by an appropriate Tribunal of a trustee to administer any Plan, or the termination of any Plan within the meaning of Title IV of ERISA, and any of the foregoing results in a material liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation; or any Plan fails to satisfy the “minimum funding standards” of ERISA or is determined to be in “at risk” status (within the meaning of ERISA).
(g)    Misrepresentation. Any representation or warranty made by the Company is untrue in any material respect, or any certificate, schedule, statement, report, notice or writing (excluding any Appraisal, for which the Company makes no representation) furnished by the Company to the Administrative Agent or to the Banks, or any of them, is untrue in any material respect on the date as of which the facts set forth are stated or certified, shall remain material at the time of discovery and shall, if curable, remain incorrect in any material respect after 30 days after written notice thereof to the Company (it being understood that any failure by the Company to include within any such schedule, statement, report, notice, or writing any information the omission of which would cause the material included to be misleading shall be as much an untruth as a false statement contained therein).
Section 7.2     Remedies Upon Default. If an Event of Default specified in Section 7.l(c) occurs, the obligation of each Bank to make Loans hereunder shall thereupon automatically terminate (unless previously terminated) and the aggregate unpaid principal balance of and accrued interest on the Obligation

40



shall thereupon become due and payable concurrently therewith, without any action by the Administrative Agent or any Bank and without diligence, presentment, demand, protest, notice of protest or intent to accelerate, or notice of any other kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, should any other Event of Default occur and be continuing, the Administrative Agent may, and if requested by the Majority Banks, shall, do any one or more of the following:
(a)    Acceleration. Declare (by written notice to the Company) the entire unpaid balance of the Loans, all interest accrued and unpaid thereon and the other Obligation, or any part thereof, immediately due and payable, whereupon it shall be due and payable, without diligence, presentment, demand, protest, notice of protest or intent to accelerate, or other notice of any kind (except any notice or demand specified in this Agreement), all of which are hereby expressly waived.
(b)    Termination. Terminate the Commitments by written notice to the Company (unless previously terminated).
(c)    Judgment. Reduce any claim to judgment.
(d)    Rights. Exercise any and all legal and equitable Rights available to it.
Section 7.3     Remedies in General. If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Administrative Agent may immediately proceed to protect and enforce all or any Rights with respect thereto contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Papers or may enforce any other legal or equitable Rights. Any Right may be exercised from time to time, independently or concurrently, and as often as shall be deemed expedient. No waiver of any Event of Default shall extend to any subsequent Event of Default.
ARTICLE VIII
THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
Section 8.1     Authorization and Action. Each Bank hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to act as its Administrative Agent hereunder and under each of the other Loan Papers. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. consents to such appointment as Administrative Agent and agrees to perform the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Papers. Each Bank authorizes and directs the Administrative Agent to act on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are specifically delegated to or required of the Administrative Agent by the terms hereto, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement or the other Loan Papers (including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of the Loans or Notes), the Administrative Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Majority Banks, and such instructions shall be binding upon all Banks and all holders of Loans or Notes; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action which exposes the Administrative Agent to liability or which is contrary to this Agreement or applicable Law.
Section 8.2     Administrative Agent’s Reliance, Etc. None of the Administrative Agent and its respective Affiliates, directors, officers, agents, or employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with the Loan Papers (i) with the consent or at the request of the Majority Banks (or all the Banks, if required) or (ii) in the absence of its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct (it being the express intention of the parties that the Administrative Agent and its directors, officers, agents, and employees shall have no liability for actions and omissions under this

41



Section 8.2 resulting from their ordinary contributory negligence). Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent (i) may treat the payee of each Loan or Note as the holder thereof until the Administrative Agent receives written notice of the assignment or transfer thereof signed by such payee and in form satisfactory to the Administrative Agent; (ii) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel for the Company), independent public accountants, and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants, or experts; (iii) makes no warranty or representation to any Bank and shall not be responsible to any Bank for any statements, warranties, or representations made by or on behalf of the Company in or in connection with any Loan Paper; (iv) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants, or conditions of any Loan Paper or to inspect the property (including the books and records) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (v) shall have no responsibility to ensure the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent, (vi) shall not be responsible to any Bank for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency, or value of any Loan Paper or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; (vii) shall incur no liability under or in respect of any Loan Paper by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate, or other instrument or writing (which may be by telecopier or e-mail) reasonably believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties; and (viii) may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.
Section 8.3     Rights of the Administrative Agent as Bank. With respect to their Commitments and the Loans, if any, made by them and the Notes, if any, issued to them, the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement or any other Loan Paper as any other Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent; and the term “Bank” or “Banks” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include the Administrative Agent, in its individual capacity. The Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Company, any of the Subsidiaries and any Person who may do business with or own securities of the Company or of the Subsidiaries, all as if such Bank were not the Administrative Agent, and without any duty to account therefor to the Banks.
Section 8.4     Bank Credit Decision. Each Bank acknowledges and agrees that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Bank and based on the Current Financials and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Bank also acknowledges and agrees that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Bank and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement.
Section 8.5     Administrative Agent’s Indemnity. The Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action hereunder or to prosecute or defend any suit in respect of this Agreement or the Loans or Notes unless indemnified to the Administrative Agent’s satisfaction by the Banks against loss, cost, liability, and expense. If any indemnity furnished to the Administrative Agent shall become impaired, it may call for additional indemnity and cease to do the acts indemnified against until such additional indemnity is given. In addition, the Banks severally but not jointly agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Company), ratably according to the respective principal amounts of the Loans then held by each of them (or ratably according to either (i) if prior to funding of the Loans, the respective amounts of their Commitments, or (ii) if upon and after funding of the Loans, the respective

42



amounts of the Loans outstanding hereunder; provided that, in the case of Section 2.22, when a Defaulting Bank shall exist, any such Defaulting Bank’s Commitment shall be disregarded in the calculation), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses, or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or the other Loan Papers (including, without limitation, any action taken or omitted under Article II of this Agreement); provided that no Bank shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses, or disbursements resulting from the Administrative Agent’s fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct. Each Bank agrees, however, that it expressly intends, under this Section 8.5, to indemnify the Administrative Agent ratably as aforesaid for all such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses, and disbursements arising out of or resulting from the Administrative Agent’s ordinary or contributory negligence. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Bank agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable counsel fees) incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, administration, or enforcement of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement and the other Loan Papers to the extent that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by the Company. The provisions of this Section 8.5 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and/or the payment or assignment of any of the Loans or Notes.
Section 8.6     Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Banks and the Company and may be removed as Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Papers at any time with or without cause by the Majority Banks. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Majority Banks shall have the right, with the consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, of the Company (provided that the Company’s consent shall not be required during the continuance of a Default or an Event of Default), to appoint a successor Administrative Agent. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 calendar days after the retiring Administrative Agent’s giving notice of resignation or the Majority Banks’ removal of the retiring Administrative Agent, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Banks, with the consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, of the Company (provided that the Company’s consent shall not be required during the continuance of a Default or Event of Default), appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a commercial bank organized under the Laws of the United States of America or of any state thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Papers by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Papers. After any retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation or removal as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Papers, the provisions of this Article VIII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Papers.
Section 8.7     Notice of Default. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from a Bank or the Company referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a “notice of default.” If the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Banks; provided, however, if such notice is received from a Bank, the Administrative Agent also shall give notice thereof to

43



the Company. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to take action or refrain from taking action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as provided in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2.
ARTICLE IX

MISCELLANEOUS
Section 9.1     Amendments, Etc No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Paper, nor consent to any departure by the Company herefrom or therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Majority Banks (or the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Majority Banks) in all cases, and then, in any case, such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no amendment, waiver, or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by each Bank directly affected thereby (or the Administrative Agent with the consent of each Bank directly affected thereby), do any of the following: (a) increase the amount of the Commitments of any Banks or subject any Banks to any additional obligations, (b) reduce the principal of, or rate or amount of interest applicable to, any Loan other than as provided in this Agreement, or any fees hereunder, (c) postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Loans or any fees hereunder, (d) extend the Maturity Date, (e) eliminate or reduce the voting rights of any Bank under this Section 9.1, (f) amend Section 2.15 in any manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments or Commitment reductions required thereby or (g) change the percentage of the Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans, or the number of Banks, which shall be required for the Banks or any of them to take any action hereunder; and provided, further, that no amendment, waiver, or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent in addition to the Banks required above to take such action, affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Paper, or modify or waive any provision of Section 2.22.

Section 9.3     No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of any Bank or the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any Right hereunder or under any other Loan Paper shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such Right, or any abandonment or discontinuance of any steps to enforce such Right, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other Right. No notice to or demand on the Company in any case shall entitle the Company to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. The Rights herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any Rights provided by Law.
Section 9.4     Costs, Expenses and Taxes. The Company agrees to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent for paying: (i) all reasonable costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent in connection with (A) the preparation, execution, delivery, and administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Papers, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of counsel for the Administrative Agent with respect thereto and with respect to advising the Administrative Agent as to their respective Rights and responsibilities under this Agreement and the other Loan Papers, and (B) any amendment, modification, supplement, or waiver of any of the terms of this Agreement, and (ii) all reasonable costs and expenses of the Banks and the Administrative Agent (including reasonable counsel’s fees, and including reasonable allocated in-house counsel fees for any Bank or the Administrative Agent) in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement and the other Loan Papers. In addition, the Company shall pay any and all Taxes payable or determined to be payable in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Papers, and agrees to save the Administrative Agent and each Bank harmless from and against any and all liabilities with respect to or resulting from any delay in paying or omitting to pay such Taxes, if any, which may be payable or determined to be payable in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any other Loan Paper. The obligations of the Company under this Section 9.4 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and/or repayment of the Loans.
Section 9.5     Indemnity. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and the Banks and each of their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and representatives against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, claims, costs, deficiencies, expenses, and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent, any Bank, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors or other representatives in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Papers, any transaction related hereto, or any act, omission, or transaction of the Company, its Subsidiaries, and Affiliates, or any of their employees, officers, directors or other representatives, to the extent that any of the same results, directly or indirectly, from any claims made or actions, suits, or proceedings commenced by or on behalf of any person other than the Administrative Agent or a Bank.
The obligation of the Company under this section shall continue for a period of one year after payment of the Obligation and termination of any or all Loan Papers, and SHALL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT SUCH LOSSES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES, LIABILITIES AND RELATED EXPENSES ARE IN ANY WAY OR TO ANY EXTENT OWED, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, UNDER ANY CLAIM OR THEORY OF STRICT LIABILITY OR CAUSED, IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY ANY NEGLIGENT ACT OR OMISSION OF ANY KIND BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR ANY BANK;
provided, however, that (i) although each indemnified party shall have the right to be indemnified from its own ordinary negligence, no indemnified party shall have the right to be indemnified hereunder for willful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith to the extent found by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and (ii) the indemnity set forth in this Section 9.5 shall not apply to any liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, claims, costs, deficiencies, expenses or disbursements resulting from a proceeding that does not involve an act or omission

46



by the Company or any of its affiliates and that is brought by an indemnified party against any other indemnified party (other than claims against the Administrative Agent in its capacity or in fulfilling its role as the Administrative Agent under the Loan Papers).
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any indemnified party, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Papers or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.
Section 9.6     Right of Setoff. If any Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing, each Bank and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Bank or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Company against any and all obligations of the Company now or hereafter existing under this Agreement and the Loans held by such Bank or Affiliate, irrespective of whether or not such Bank or Affiliate shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any Note and although such obligations may be unmatured. Each Bank agrees promptly to notify the Company and the Administrative Agent after any such setoff and application made by such Bank or Affiliate, but the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. The Rights of each Bank under this Section 9.6 are in addition to the Rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other Rights of setoff) which such Bank may have.
Section 9.7     GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
Section 9.8     Submission To Jurisdiction; Waivers. The Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally:
(a)    submits for itself and its property in any legal action or proceeding relating to this Agreement and the other Loan Papers to which it is a party, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan (or if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan), and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Paper or the transactions relating hereto or thereto, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may (and any such claims, cross-claims or third party claims brought against the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates and the respective directors, officers, employees, agents and advisors may only) be heard and determined in such Federal (to the extent permitted by law) or New York State court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law;
(b)    consents that any such action or proceeding may be brought in such courts and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same;

47



(c)    agrees that service of process in any such action or proceeding may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to the Company, as the case may be at its address set forth in Section 9.2 or at such other address of which the Administrative Agent shall have been notified pursuant thereto; and
(d)    agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect service of process in any other manner permitted by law or shall limit the right to sue in any other jurisdiction.
Section 9.9     Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and warranties contained herein or made in writing by the Company in connection herewith shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Papers, and no investigation by the Administrative Agent or any Bank or any closing shall affect the representations and warranties or the Right of the Administrative Agent or any Bank to rely upon them.
Section 9.10     Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Company, the Administrative Agent, and each Bank and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company (subject to the provisions of Section 9.11), the Administrative Agent, each Bank and their respective successors and assigns.
Section 9.11     Successors and Assigns; Participations
(a)    Whenever in this Agreement any of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the successors and permitted assigns of such party, and all covenants, promises, agreements, representations and warranties by or on behalf of the Company, the Administrative Agent or the Banks that are contained in this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of their respective successors and assigns. Except for any assignment or transfer by the Company of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to a Successor Company in accordance with Section 6.14, the Company may not assign or transfer any its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of all of the Banks.
(b)    Each Bank may without the consent of the Company sell participations to one or more banks or other entities in all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment or the Loans owing to it and any Note or Notes held by it); provided, however, that (i) such Bank’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Bank shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) such Bank shall remain the holder of its Loans and Notes (if any) for all purposes of this Agreement, (iv) the participating banks or other entities shall be entitled to the cost protection provisions contained in Article II and Section 9.4, but only to the extent that such protection would have been available to such Bank, calculated as if no such participations had been sold, and the indemnity protection provisions contained in Section 9.5, (v) the Company, the Administrative Agent, and the other Banks shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, and (vi) such Bank shall not sell a participation that conveys to the participant the right to vote or give or withhold consents under this Agreement or any other Loan Papers, other than the right to vote upon or consent to (y) amendments, modifications, or waivers with respect to any fees payable hereunder (including the dates fixed for the payment of any such fees) or the amount of principal or the rate of interest payable on, or the dates fixed for any payment of principal of or interest on, the Loans and (z) any extension of the Maturity Date. Each Bank that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Company, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Bank shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary

48



to establish that a Commitment, Loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Bank shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.
(c)    Each Bank may assign to one or more Persons (other than a natural person, a Defaulting Bank or the Company or any of its Affiliates), all or a portion of its interests, rights, and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans at the time owing to it); provided, however, that (i) such assignment, if not to a Bank or an Eligible Affiliate Assignee of the assigning Bank, shall be consented to by the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and shall not be required after the occurrence or during the continuance of a Default or Event of Default), the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (ii) each Bank’s Commitment or Loans to be assigned shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless (x) otherwise agreed by the Company and the Administrative Agent, (y) in the case of the assigning Bank, such amount is reduced to zero pursuant to such assignment or (z) the assignment is to a Bank, (iii) each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not a varying, percentage of all the assigning Bank’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, (iv) the assignee thereof shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent any Internal Revenue Service forms required by Section 2.18, and (v) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register (as defined below), an Assignment and Assumption substantially in the form of Exhibit E hereto (an “Assignment and Assumption”), together with a properly completed Administrative Questionnaire, any Note or Notes subject to such assignment and a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (or such lesser amount as shall be acceptable to the Administrative Agent); provided, however, no such fee shall be required in the case of any assignment requested by the Company pursuant to Article II of this Agreement. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance, and recording, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, which effective date shall be at least five Business Days after the execution thereof (unless a shorter period shall be agreed to by the Company, the Administrative Agent, and the assignor Bank), (x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent provided in such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Bank hereunder and under the other Loan Papers and (y) the assignor Bank thereunder shall, to the extent provided in such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Papers (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the remaining portion of an assigning Bank’s rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Papers, such Bank shall cease to be a party hereto and thereto).
(d)    By executing and delivering an Assignment and Assumption, the Bank assignor thereunder and the assignee confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than the representations and warranties that (x) it is the legal and beneficial owner of the interest being assigned thereby, (y) the interest being assigned thereby is free and clear of any lien, encumbrance or other adverse claim and (z) it has full power and authority, and has taken all action necessary, to execute and deliver such Assignment and Assumption and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby, such Bank assignor makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties, or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Paper or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency, or value of this Agreement, any other Loan Paper or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) such Bank assignor makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of the Company or the performance or observance of its respective obligations under this Agreement, any other Loan Paper or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; (iii) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement together with copies of financial information and such

49



other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Assumption; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, such Bank assignor, or any other Bank and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action on behalf of such assignee and to exercise such powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Papers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vi) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Bank.
(e)    The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Banks and the Commitment of, or principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Bank from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Company, the Administrative Agent, and the Banks may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Bank hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Company, any Bank or the Administrative Agent at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(f)    Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Bank and an assignee together with any Note or Notes subject to such assignment and the written consent to such assignment, the Administrative Agent shall, if such Assignment and Assumption has been completed and is substantially in the form of Exhibit E hereto, (i) accept such Assignment and Assumption, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register, and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Banks, the Administrative Agent and the Company. Within five Business Days after receipt of such notice, the Company, at its own expense, shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent in exchange for the surrendered Note or Notes, if any, (x) a new Note or Notes to the order of such assignee in an amount equal to its portion of the Loan assumed by it pursuant to such Assignment and Assumption and (y) if the assigning Bank has retained any Loan hereunder, new Notes to the order of the assigning Bank in an amount equal to the Loan retained by it hereunder. Such new Notes shall be in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of such surrendered Notes. Such new Notes shall be dated the effective date of such Assignment and Assumption and shall otherwise be in substantially the form of Exhibit D-1 or D-2 as applicable, hereto. Cancelled Notes shall be returned to the Company.
(g)    Notwithstanding any other provision herein, any Bank may, in connection with any assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 9.11 (or in connection with any swap, derivative, securitization or credit insurance relating to the Company and its obligations), disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant (or to any direct, indirect, actual or prospective counterparty (and its advisor) to any such swap, derivative or securitization) any information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished to such Bank by or on behalf of the Company; provided, that prior to any such disclosure, each such assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant (or any such counterparty (and its advisor)) shall agree for the benefit of the Company to preserve the confidentiality of any confidential information relating to the Company received from such Bank.
(h)    Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement, any Bank may at any time create a security interest in all or any portion of its Rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Loans owing to it and any Notes held by it) in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Fed Reserve Board.

50



Section 9.12     Confidentiality. The Administrative Agent and each Bank agrees to keep confidential all Information (as defined below); provided that nothing herein shall prevent the Administrative Agent or any Bank from disclosing any such Information (a) to the Administrative Agent, any Bank or any affiliate thereof, (b) as permitted by Section 9.11(g), (c) to its employees, directors, agents, attorneys, accountants and other professional advisors or those of any of its affiliates in each case on a need-to-know basis, (d) upon the request or demand of any Governmental Authority, (e) in response to any order of any court or other Governmental Authority or as may otherwise be required pursuant to any Law, (f) if requested or required to do so in connection with any litigation or similar proceeding, (g) that has been publicly disclosed, (h) to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any similar organization or any nationally recognized rating agency that requires access to information about a Bank’s investment portfolio in connection with ratings issued with respect to such Bank, (i) in connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Paper, or (j) if agreed by the Company in its sole discretion, to any other Person. “Information” means all information received from the Company relating to the Company or its business, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Bank on a non-confidential basis prior to disclosure by the Company and other than information pertaining to this Agreement routinely provided by arrangers to data service providers, including league table providers, that serve the lending industry; provided that in the case of information received from the Company after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section 9.12 shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.
Each Bank acknowledges that information furnished to it pursuant to this Agreement or the other Loan Papers may include material non-public information concerning the Company and its Affiliates and their related parties or their respective securities, and confirms that it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public information and that it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with those procedures and applicable law, including Federal and state securities laws.
All information, including requests for waivers and amendments, furnished by the Company or the Administrative Agent pursuant to, or in the course of administering, this Agreement or the other Loan Papers will be syndicate-level information, which may contain material non-public information about the Company and its Affiliates and their related parties or their respective securities. Accordingly, each Bank represents to the Company and the Administrative Agent that it has identified in its Administrative Questionnaire a credit contact who may receive information that may contain material non-public information in accordance with its compliance procedures and applicable law, including Federal and state securities laws.
Section 9.13     Independence of Covenants. All covenants contained in this Agreement shall be given independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is not permitted by any such covenants, the fact that such action or condition would be permitted by an exception to, or otherwise be within the limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default if such action is taken or condition exists.
Section 9.14     Severability. Should any clause, sentence, paragraph, or Section of this Agreement be judicially declared to be invalid, unenforceable, or void, such decision will not have the effect of invalidating or voiding the remainder of this Agreement, and the parties hereto agree that the part or parts of this Agreement so held to be invalid, unenforceable, or void will be deemed to have been stricken herefrom and the remainder will have the same force and effectiveness as if such part or parts had never been included herein.

51



Section 9.15     Integration. This Agreement and the other Loan Papers represent the entire agreement of the Company, the Administrative Agent and the Banks with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and there are no promises, undertakings, representations or warranties by the Administrative Agent or any Bank relative to the subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein or in the other Loan Papers.
Section 9.16     Descriptive Headings. The section headings appearing in this Agreement have been inserted for convenience only and shall be given no substantive meaning or significance whatever in construing the terms and provisions of this Agreement.
Section 9.17     Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Section 9.18     WAIVERS OF JURY TRIAL. THE COMPANY, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE BANKS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN PAPER AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN.
Section 9.19     No Fiduciary Duty. The Administrative Agent, each Bank and their Affiliates (collectively, solely for purposes of this paragraph, the “Banks”), may have economic interests that conflict with those of the Company, its stockholders and/or its affiliates. The Company agrees that nothing in the Loan Papers or otherwise will be deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty between any Bank, on the one hand, and the Company, its stockholders or its affiliates, on the other. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the transactions contemplated by the Loan Papers (including the exercise of rights and remedies hereunder and thereunder) are arm’s-length commercial transactions between the Banks, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other, and (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading thereto, (x) no Bank has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company, its stockholders or its affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (or the exercise of rights or remedies with respect thereto) or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether any Bank has advised, is currently advising or will advise the Company, its stockholders or its affiliates on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in the Loan Papers and (y) each Bank is acting solely as principal and not as the agent or fiduciary of the Company, its management, stockholders, creditors or any other Person. The Company acknowledges and agrees that it has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate and that it is responsible for making its own independent judgment with respect to such transactions and the process leading thereto. The Company agrees that it will not claim that any Bank has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to it, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
Section 9.20     USA Patriot Act. Each Bank hereby notifies the Company that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the “Patriot Act”), it is required to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each borrower, guarantor or grantor (the “Loan Parties”), which information includes the name and address of each Loan Party and other information that will allow such Bank to identify such Loan Party in accordance with the Patriot Act. The Company agrees to provide such information as each Bank or the Administrative Agent reasonably requests in order to perform its "know your customer" due diligence.

52



Section 9.21     Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of EEA Financial Institutions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Paper or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any EEA Financial Institution arising under any Loan Paper may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of an EEA Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:
(a)    the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by an EEA Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an EEA Financial Institution; and
(b)    the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:
(i)    a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;
(ii)    a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such EEA Financial Institution, its parent entity, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Paper; or
(iii)    the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of any EEA Resolution Authority.
Section 9.22     Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively the “Charges”), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the “Maximum Rate”) which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Bank holding such Loan in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable to such Bank in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable to such Bank in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable to such Bank in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such Bank in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Bank.

March 12, 2020

The Banks and the Administrative Agent
Referred to Below

RE: Loans to Southwest Airlines Co.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 This opinion is furnished pursuant to Section 4.1(b)(iv) of the $1,000,000,000 364-Day Credit Agreement dated as of March 12, 2020 (the "Credit Agreement"), among Southwest Airlines Co. (the "Company"), the Bank parties thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Credit Agreement.
 I am the Executive Vice President, Chief Legal and Regulatory Officer of the Company and solely in such capacity have examined, either personally or through attorneys under my supervision, originals, or copies certified to my satisfaction, of the Credit Agreement, and such corporate records, certificates of corporate officials as to certain matters of fact, and instruments and documents as I have deemed necessary or advisable as a basis for the opinions set forth herein.
 In such examination, I have assumed (i) the genuineness of all signatures (other than the signatures of Persons signing on behalf of the Company), the authenticity and completeness of all documents, certificates, instruments and records submitted to me as originals and the conformity to the original instruments of all documents submitted to me as copies, and the authenticity and completeness of the originals of such copies, (ii) the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Administrative Agent and the Banks of the Credit Agreement, (iii) that the Administrative Agent and the Banks have all requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and perform the Credit Agreement and (iv) the enforceability of the Credit Agreement against the Administrative Agent and the Banks. In addition, in rendering this opinion, I have relied upon, as to certain matters of fact, certificates of officers of the Company and certificates of public officials, without any independent investigation of such matters.
 Based upon the foregoing, and relying upon the correctness of all statements of fact contained in the documents, certificates and records that I have examined either personally or through attorneys under my supervision, I am of the opinion that:

1.
The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Texas, and is duly qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the character or location of its properties or the nature or conduct of its business makes such qualification necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Company has the corporate power to own its properties and to carry on its businesses as now conducted.





2.
The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement are within its corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not conflict with or constitute a default under (i) any law, rule, regulation, order or judgment known to me or contractual restriction of the Company known to me, the violation of which would have a Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) the Restated Certificate of Formation or the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company.

3.
No authorization or approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body is required by the laws of the State of Texas, or the federal laws of the United States of America for the due execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement other than routine filings of copies of the Credit Agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

4.
To my knowledge, except as set forth in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 and subsequent Form 8-Ks, there are no legal or governmental proceedings or investigations pending or threatened against the Company or any Subsidiary or any property of the Company or any Subsidiary which individually or, to the extent involving related claims, in the aggregate, involve a material risk of a Material Adverse Effect on (i) the financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries considered as a whole, or (ii) the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under the Credit Agreement.

This opinion is for the sole benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Banks and may not be relied upon by any other Person without the express prior written consent of the undersigned. I am licensed to practice law only in the State of Texas and I express no opinion as to matters not governed by the laws of the United States of America or the laws of the State of Texas (except for the usury laws and choice-of-laws provisions of the State of Texas, as to which I express no opinion). ·

Very truly,


Mark Shaw
Executive Vice President, Chief Legal and Regulatory Officer

March 12, 2020

To the Banks and the Administrative Agent referred to below
Re:    Southwest Airlines Co. $1,000,000,000 364-Day Credit Facility
 Ladies and Gentlemen:
  This opinion is furnished pursuant to Section 4.l(b)(iv) of the $1,000,000,000 364-Day Credit Facility Agreement dated as of March 12, 2020 (the "Credit Agreement"), among Southwest Airlines Co. (the "Company"), the Banks parties thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent. For convenience of reference, terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used therein with the same meanings.
 We have acted as special New York counsel of the Company in connection with the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the financing as contemplated by the Credit Agreement, and in this connection, we have examined, among other things, an executed copy of the Credit Agreement.
 We have also reviewed such other documents and certificates and such matters of law as we have considered relevant hereto. We have assumed, for purposes of our opinion hereinafter set forth, (i) that the Credit Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by each of the parties thereto and that, except as expressly made the subject of our opinions in the following paragraph, the Credit Agreement constitutes the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of each of the parties thereto. As to any other facts material to our opinions expressed herein, we have relied upon the representations and warranties contained in the Credit Agreement and related documents and certificates and upon originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such corporate records, documents, certificates and other instruments as in our judgment are necessary or appropriate to enable us to render this opinion. We have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons executing documents and the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity with the authentic originals of all documents submitted to us as copies.
 Based upon and subject to the foregoing and having regard to legal considerations which we deem relevant, and subject to the comments and qualifications set forth below, we are of the opinion that the Credit Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except that no opinion is expressed herein as to (A) whether a court outside of the State of New York would give effect to the choice of New York law provided for in the Credit Agreement, (B) any provision in the Credit Agreement relating to the severability of provisions in such documents, (C) any provision of the Credit Agreement that requires any amendment or waiver thereof to be in writing, (D) the effect of any provision of the Credit Agreement imposing penalties or forfeitures, (E) Section 2.16 of the Credit Agreement, (F) Section 9.8 of the Credit Agreement insofar as it relates to submission




to the jurisdiction of United States Federal Courts or (G) Section 9.18 of the Credit Agreement. Further, we wish to point out that provisions of the Credit Agreement that permit any party thereto to make determinations or to take actions may be subject to a requirement that such determinations be made, and that such actions be taken, on a reasonable basis in good faith.

The opinions above are subject to:

(i)    the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding of equity or at law), including, without limitation, (x) the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy and (y) concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing;

(ii)    all applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or similar laws, decrees or regulations affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally; and

(iii)    with respect to indemnity, contribution and exculpation provisions contained in the Credit Agreement, limitations based upon public policy considerations.

We are members of the bar of the State of New York and we do not herein express any opinion as to matters governed by any laws other than the law of the State of New York and the Federal law of the United States of America currently in effect, in each case that in our experience are generally applicable to transaction of this type without regard to the particular nature of the businesses conducted by, or the legal or regulatory status of the Company or any other party to the Credit Agreement and furthermore we express no opinion with respect to, or with respect to the applicability to the opinions expressed herein of any (i) aviation laws; (ii) any environmental, public health, safety, intellectual property, antitrust or tax laws or laws governing labor relations, pensions or employee benefits, including the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended; (iii) financial industry regulatory authority rules and any laws relating to bribery, corruption, money-laundering, anti-terrorism, communications, customs, imports or exports, insurance, international trade, sanctions or embargoes (whether foreign trade, economic, financial or otherwise), public utilities, commodities trading, futures or swaps; (iv) compliance with fiduciary duty requirements; or (v) any laws, rules, regulations or ordinances of any county, town or municipality or subdivision or agency thereof. Further, we express no opinion as to the Company's interest in any Pool Assets or any security interest, or grant thereof, in any property.
This opinion letter is limited to, and no opinion is implied or may be inferred beyond, the matters expressly stated herein. The opinions expressed herein are rendered only as of the date hereof, and we assume no responsibility to advise you of facts, circumstances, changes in law, or other events or developments that hereafter may occur or be brought to our attention and that may alter, affect or modify the opinions expressed herein.

In connection with the provisions of the Credit Agreement whereby the Company submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States of America located in the City of New York, Borough of Manhattan, we note the limitations of 28 U.S.C.
