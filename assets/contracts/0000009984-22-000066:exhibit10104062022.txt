1.4Letter of Credit Amounts.
Unless otherwise specified herein, the amount of a Letter of Credit at any time shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent of the stated amount of such Letter of Credit in effect at such time; provided, however, that with respect to any Letter of Credit that, by its terms or the terms of any Issuer Document related thereto, provides for one or more automatic increases in the stated amount thereof, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent of the maximum stated amount of such Letter of Credit after giving effect to all such increases, whether or not such maximum stated amount is in effect at such time.
1.5Exchange Rates; Currency Equivalents.
(a)The Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, as applicable, shall determine the Dollar Equivalent amounts of Credit Extensions, L/C Obligations, and the outstanding principal amount of Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies.

Except for purposes of financial statements delivered by Loan Parties hereunder or calculating financial covenants hereunder or except as otherwise provided herein, the applicable amount of any currency (other than Dollars) for purposes of the Loan Documents shall be such Dollar Equivalent amount as so determined by the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, as applicable.

(b)Wherever in this Credit Agreement in connection with a Loan, conversion, continuation or prepayment of an Alternative Currency Loan or the issuance, amendment or extension of a Letter of Credit, an amount, such as a required minimum or multiple amount, is expressed in Dollars, but such Credit Extension, Loan or Letter of Credit is denominated in an Alternative Currency, such amount shall be the relevant Alternative Currency Equivalent of such Dollar amount, as determined by the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be.
(c)The Administrative Agent does not warrant, nor accept responsibility, nor shall the Administrative Agent have any liability with respect to the administration, submission or any other matter related to any reference rate referred to herein or with respect to any rate (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the selection of such rate and any related spread or other adjustment) that is an alternative or replacement for or successor to any such rate (including, without limitation, any Successor Rate or any component of any of the foregoing) or the effect of any of the foregoing, or of any Conforming Changes.
1.6Additional Alternative Currencies.
(a)A Borrower may from time to time request that Alternative Currency Loans be made and/or Letters of Credit be issued in a currency other than those specifically listed in the definition of “Alternative Currency;” provided that such requested currency is an Eligible Currency. In the case of any such request with respect to the making of Alternative Currency Loans, such request shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders; and in the case of any such request with respect to the issuance of Letters of Credit, such request shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank.

In the case of any such request pertaining to Alternative Currency Loans, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof; and in the case of any such request pertaining to Letters of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Issuing Bank thereof.

DB3/ 204224713.6

37

(c)Any failure by a Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to respond to such request within the time period specified in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to be a refusal by such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to permit Alternative Currency Loans to be made or Letters of Credit to be issued in such requested currency. If the Administrative Agent and all the Lenders consent to making Alternative Currency Loans in such requested currency and the Administrative Agent and such Lenders reasonably determine that an appropriate interest rate is available to be used for such requested currency, the Administrative Agent shall so notify BGI and (i) the Administrative Agent and such Lenders may amend the definition of Alternative Currency Daily Rate or Alternative Currency Term Rate to the extent necessary to add the applicable rate for such currency and any applicable adjustment for such rate and (ii) to the extent the definition of Alternative Currency Daily Rate or Alternative Currency Term Rate, as applicable, has been amended to reflect the appropriate rate for such currency, such currency shall thereupon be deemed for all purposes to be an Alternative Currency for purposes of any borrowings of Alternative Currency Loans. If the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank consent to the issuance of Letters of Credit in such requested currency, the Administrative Agent shall so notify BGI and (iii) the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank may amend the definition of Alternative Currency Daily Rate or Alternative Currency Term Rate, as applicable, to the extent necessary to add the applicable rate for such currency and any applicable adjustment for such rate and (iv) to the extent the definition of Alternative Currency Daily Rate or Alternative Currency Term Rate, as applicable, has been amended to reflect the appropriate rate for such currency, such currency shall thereupon be deemed for all purposes to be an Alternative Currency, for purposes of any Letter of Credit issuances.

1.7Change of Currency.
(a)Each obligation of any Borrower to make a payment denominated in the national currency unit of any member state of the European Union that adopts the Euro as its lawful currency after the date hereof shall be redenominated into Euro at the time of such adoption. If, in relation to the currency of any such member state, the basis of accrual of interest expressed in this Credit Agreement in respect of that currency shall be inconsistent with any convention or practice in the London interbank market for the basis of accrual of interest in respect of the Euro, such expressed basis shall be replaced by such convention or practice with effect from the date on which such member state adopts the Euro as its lawful currency; provided that if any Loan made in the currency of such member state is outstanding immediately prior to such date, such replacement shall take effect, with respect to such Loan, at the end of the then current Interest Period.
(b)Each provision of this Credit Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to time specify to be appropriate to reflect the adoption of the Euro by any member state of the European Union and any relevant market conventions or practices relating to the Euro.

The Loans shall be made pro rata in accordance with each Lender’s Commitment Percentage. Each request for a Loan hereunder shall constitute a representation and warranty by BGI, Barnes Germany, Barnes Luxembourg or Barnes Switzerland, as the case may be, that the conditions set forth in §11 and §12, in the case of the initial Loans to be made on the Closing Date, and §12, in the case of all other Loans, have been satisfied on the date of such request.

2.3Reduction of Total Commitment. BGI shall have the right at any time and from time to time upon three (3) Business Days prior written notice to the Administrative Agent to reduce by $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof or to terminate entirely the Total Commitment, whereupon the Commitments of the Lenders shall be reduced pro rata in accordance with their respective Commitment Percentages of the amount specified in such notice or, as the case may be, terminated. Promptly after receiving any notice of BGI delivered pursuant to this §2.3, the Administrative Agent will notify the Lenders of the substance thereof. The amount of any such Total Commitment reduction shall not be applied to the Alternative Currency Sublimit or the Letter of Credit Sublimit, unless the Total Commitment is reduced to a level below the Alternative Currency Sublimit or the Letter of Credit Sublimit, as applicable, unless otherwise specified by BGI. Upon the effective date of any such reduction or termination, BGI shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the respective accounts of the Lenders the full amount of any Facility Fee then accrued on the amount of the reduction. No reduction or termination of the Commitments may be reinstated.
2.3.1.Increase of Total Commitment. Unless a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, BGI may request, with prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, and subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent if with respect to a new lender, that the Total Commitment be increased, provided that the Total Commitment shall not, except with the consent of the Required Lenders, in any event exceed $1,250,000,000 hereunder, and provided, further, that (i) any Lender which is a party to this Revolving Credit Agreement prior to such increase shall have the first option to increase its Commitment hereunder, but no Lender shall have any obligation to do so, (ii) in the event that it becomes necessary to include a new Lender to provide additional funding under this §2.3.1, such new Lender must be reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and BGI, (iii) the Lenders’ Commitment Percentages shall be correspondingly adjusted, as necessary, to reflect any increase in the Total Commitment and Schedule 1 shall be amended to reflect such adjustments and (iv) BGI may make a maximum of two such requests.

2.4Evidence of Debt.
(a)The Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Loans made by the Lenders to the Borrowers and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrowers hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender to BGI, Barnes Germany, Barnes Luxembourg and/or Barnes Switzerland, as the case may be, made through the Administrative Agent, BGI, Barnes Germany, Barnes Luxembourg and/or Barnes Switzerland, as the case may be, shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender’s Loans in addition to such accounts or records.

Each such notice shall specify (i) the principal amount of the Loan requested, (ii) the proposed Drawdown Date of such Loan, (iii) the Interest Period for such Loan (if applicable), (iv) the Type of such Loan, and (v) the currency of such Loan to be borrowed. If such Borrower fails to specify a currency in a Loan Request, then the Loan so requested shall be made in Dollars. Promptly upon receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall notify each of the Lenders thereof. Each Loan Request shall be irrevocable and binding on BGI, Barnes Germany, Barnes Luxembourg and/or Barnes Switzerland, as the case may be, and shall obligate such Borrower to accept the Loan requested from the Lenders on the proposed Drawdown Date. Each Loan Request shall be in a minimum aggregate amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof, and after giving effect to all Loans, all conversions of Loans from one Type to another as provided in §2.7.1, and all continuations of Loans as the same Type as provided in §2.7.2, there shall not be more than ten (10) Interest Periods in effect with respect to the Loans.
2.7Conversion Options.
2.7.1.Conversion to Different Type of Loan. The applicable Borrower may elect from time to time to convert any outstanding Loan to a Loan of another Type, provided that (a) with respect to any such conversion of a SOFR Loan to a Base Rate Loan, a Base Rate Loan to a SOFR Loan, a Term SOFR Loan to a Daily SOFR Loan, or a Daily SOFR Loan to a Term SOFR Loan, the applicable Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent written notice (including notice given via an electronic platform or electronic transmission system approved by the Administrative Agent) no later than 11:00 a.m. (Eastern time) at least three (3) Business Days prior to such election; (b) [reserved]; (c) with respect to any such conversion of an Alternative Currency Loan, the applicable Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent written notice (including notice given via an electronic platform or electronic transmission system approved by the Administrative Agent) no later than 11:00 a.m. (Eastern time) at least four (4) Business Days (or five (5) Business Days in the case of a Special Notice Currency) prior to such election; (d) with respect to any such conversion of a Term SOFR Loan or an Alternative Currency Term Rate Loan into a Base Rate Loan, such conversion shall only be made on the last day of the Interest Period with respect thereto and (e) no Loan may be converted into a SOFR Loan, Alternative Currency Daily Rate Loan, or an Alternative Currency Term Rate Loan when any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. On the date on
DB3/ 204224713.6

42

which such conversion is being made each Lender shall take such action as is necessary to transfer its Commitment Percentage of such Loans to its Domestic Lending Office or its Lending Office, as the case may be. All or any part of outstanding Loans of any Type may be converted into a Loan of another Type as provided herein, provided, that any partial conversion shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. Each Conversion Request relating to the conversion of a Loan (other than a conversion to a Base Rate Loan) shall be irrevocable by the Borrowers. No Loan may be converted into a Loan denominated in a different currency, but instead must be prepaid in the original currency of such Loan and reborrowed in the other currency.
2.7.2.Continuation of Type of Loan. Any Term SOFR Loan or Alternative Currency Term Rate Loan may be continued as a Loan of the same Type upon the expiration of an Interest Period with respect thereto by compliance by the applicable Borrower with the notice provisions contained in §2.7.1; provided that no Loan other than a Base Rate Loan may be continued as such when any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, but shall be automatically converted to a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the first Interest Period relating thereto ending during the continuance of any Default or Event of Default of which officers of the Administrative Agent active upon the Borrowers’ account have actual knowledge. In the event that the applicable Borrower fails to provide any such notice with respect to the continuation of any Loan as such, then (i) in the case of a Term SOFR Loan, such Term SOFR Loan shall be automatically converted to a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the current Interest Period relating thereto and (ii) in the case of an Alternative Currency Term Rate Loan, such Alternative Currency Term Rate Loan shall be continued as an Alternative Currency Term Rate Loan in its original currency with an Interest Period of one (1) month. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders promptly when any such automatic conversion contemplated by this §2.7 is scheduled to occur. No Loan may be continued as a Loan denominated in a different currency, but instead must be prepaid in the original currency of such Loan and reborrowed in the other currency.
2.7.3.Term SOFR and Alternative Currency Term Rate Loans. Any conversion to or from Term SOFR and Alternative Currency Term Rate Loans shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of all Term SOFR and Alternative Currency Term Rate Loans having the same Interest Period shall not be less than $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

2.8Funds for Loan.
2.8.1.Funding Procedures. Not later than 2:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the proposed Drawdown Date of any Loans denominated in Dollars and not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of any Loans in an Alternative Currency, each of the Lenders will make available to the Administrative Agent, at the Administrative Agent’s Office, in Same Day Funds, the amount of such Lender’s Commitment Percentage of the amount of the requested Loans for the applicable currency. Upon receipt from each Lender of such amount, and upon receipt of the documents required by §§11 and 12 and the satisfaction of the other conditions set forth therein, to the extent applicable, the Administrative Agent will make available to BGI, Barnes Germany, Barnes Luxembourg and/or Barnes Switzerland, as the case may be, the aggregate amount of such Loans made available to the Administrative Agent by the Lenders. The failure or refusal of any Lender to make available to the Administrative Agent at the aforesaid time and place on any Drawdown Date the amount of its Commitment Percentage of the requested Loans shall not relieve any other Lender from its several obligation hereunder to make available to the Administrative Agent the amount of such other Lender’s Commitment Percentage of any requested Loans.

2.8.2.Advances by Administrative Agent. (a) The Administrative Agent may, unless notified to the contrary by any Lender prior to a Drawdown Date or the Applicable Time, as the case may be, assume that such Lender has made available to the Administrative Agent on such Drawdown Date or Applicable Time, as the case may be, the amount of such Lender’s Commitment Percentage of the Loans to be made on such Drawdown Date or Applicable Time, as the case may be, and the Administrative Agent may (but it shall not be required to), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to BGI, Barnes Germany, Barnes Luxembourg and/or Barnes Switzerland, as the case may be, a corresponding amount. If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent such amount on a date after such Drawdown Date or Applicable Time, as the case may be, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Commitment Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is paid by such Lender, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing. If the amount of such Lender’s Commitment Percentage of such Loans is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three (3) Business Days following such Drawdown Date or Applicable Time, as the case may be, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount from the applicable Borrower on demand, with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to the Loans made on such Drawdown Date or Applicable Time, as the case may be. The obligations of any Lender under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Credit Agreement.
(b)The Administrative Agent may, unless notified to the contrary by BGI, Barnes Germany, Barnes Luxembourg and/or Barnes Switzerland, as the case may be, prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank hereunder, as applicable, that the applicable Borrower will not make such payment, assume that the applicable Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the applicable Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally
DB3/ 204224713.6

44

agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the applicable Overnight Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing.
(c)With respect to any payment that the Administrative Agent makes for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank hereunder as to which the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that any of the following applies (such payment referred to as the “Rescindable Amount”): (1) the Borrower has not in fact made such payment; (2) the Administrative Agent has made a payment in excess of the amount so paid by the Borrower (whether or not then owed); or (3) the Administrative Agent has for any reason otherwise erroneously made such payment; then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the Rescindable Amount so distributed to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate.
(d)A statement of the Administrative Agent submitted to a Lender with respect to any amounts owing under clause (a), (b) or (c) above shall be prima facie evidence of the amount due and owing to the Administrative Agent by such Lender.

Each Foreign Swing Line Loan borrowed by Barnes Germany, Barnes Luxembourg and/or Barnes Switzerland shall be an Overnight Rate Loan or an €STR Loan. Immediately upon the making of a Swing Line Loan, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swing Line Lender a risk participation in such Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to the product of such Lender’s Commitment Percentage times the amount of such Swing Line Loan.

2.9.2.Borrowing Procedures. Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made upon BGI’s irrevocable notice to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone. Each such notice must be received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the proposed Drawdown Date, or in the case of a Foreign Swing Line Loan, (x) not later than 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the proposed Drawdown Date for any Foreign Swing Line Borrowing requested in Euros or Sterling and (y) not later than 3:00 p.m. (London time) one (1) Business Day prior to the proposed Drawdown Date for any Foreign Swing Line Borrowing requested in Swiss Francs or Dollars, and in the case of all Swing Line Borrowings, each such notice shall specify (i) the amount to be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of $100,000, and (ii) the requested borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day. Each such telephonic notice must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent of a written Swing Line Loan Request, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of BGI, Barnes Germany, Barnes Luxembourg and/or Barnes Switzerland, as the case may be. Promptly after receipt by the Swing Line Lender of any telephonic Swing Line Loan Request, the Swing Line Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has also received such Swing Line Loan Request and, if not, the Swing Line Lender will notify the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing)

of the contents thereof. Unless the Swing Line Lender has received notice (by telephone or in writing) from the Administrative Agent (including at the request of any Lender) prior to 2:00 p.m. on the date of the proposed Swing Line Borrowing (A) directing the Swing Line Lender not to make such Swing Line Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the first proviso to the first sentence of either §2.9.1(a) or (b), as applicable, or (B) that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in §11 or §12 is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swing Line Lender will, not later than 3:00 p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such Swing Line Loan Request, make the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to the applicable Borrower at its office by crediting the account of such Borrower on the books of the Swing Line Lender in immediately available funds.
2.9.3.Refinancing of Swing Line Loans.
(a)The Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole discretion may request, on behalf of each Borrower (which hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swing Line Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Lender make a Base Rate Loan, €STR Loan or Overnight Rate Loan, as applicable, in an amount equal to such Lender’s Commitment Percentage of the amount of Swing Line Loans then outstanding. Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Loan Request for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of §2.6, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, €STR Loans or Overnight Rate Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of the Total Commitments and the conditions set forth in §12. The Swing Line Lender shall furnish BGI with a copy of the applicable Loan Request promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Lender shall make an amount equal to its Commitment Percentage of the amount specified in such Loan Request available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral available with respect to the applicable Swing Line Loan) for the account of the Swing Line Lender at the Administrative Agent’s Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day specified in such Loan Request, whereupon, subject to §2.9.3(b), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan, €STR Loan or Overnight Rate Loan, as applicable, to the applicable Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swing Line Lender.
(b)If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be refinanced by such a borrowing in accordance with §2.9.3(a), the request for Base Rate Loans, €STR Loans or Overnight Rate Loans, as the case may be, submitted by the Swing Line Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swing Line Lender that each of the Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan and each Lender’s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender pursuant to §2.9.3(a) shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation.

(c)If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this §2.9 by the time specified in §2.9.3(a), the Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Swing Line Lender in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in the relevant borrowing or funded participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan, as the case may be. A certificate of the Swing Line Lender submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (c) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d)Each Lender’s obligation to make Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans pursuant to this §2.9.3 shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Swing Line Lender, any Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Lender’s obligation to make Loans pursuant to this §2.9.3 is subject to the conditions set forth in §12. No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of each Borrower to repay Swing Line Loans, together with interest as provided herein.
2.9.4.Repayment of Participations.
(a)At any time after any Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swing Line Loan, if the Swing Line Lender receives any payment on account of such Swing Line Loan, the Swing Line Lender will distribute to such Lender its Commitment Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by the Swing Line Lender.
(b)If any payment received by the Swing Line Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to be returned by the Swing Line Lender under any of the circumstances described in §16.1 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swing Line Lender in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Swing Line Lender its Commitment Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of the Swing Line Lender. The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Credit Agreement.

2.9.5.Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender. The Swing Line Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the Borrowers for interest on the Swing Line Loans. Until each Lender funds its Base Rate Loan, €STR Loan, Overnight Rate Loan or risk participation pursuant to this §2.9 to refinance such Lender’s Commitment Percentage of any Swing Line Loan, interest in respect of such Commitment Percentage shall be solely for the account of the Swing Line Lender.
2.9.6.Payments Directly to Swing Line Lender. The Borrowers shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swing Line Loans directly to the Swing Line Lender.
3.REPAYMENT OF THE LOANS.
3.1Maturity. BGI promises to pay and, solely in the case of the Barnes Germany Loans, Barnes Germany promises to pay and, solely in the case of the Barnes Luxembourg Loans, Barnes Luxembourg promises to pay and, solely in the case of the Barnes Switzerland Loans, Barnes Switzerland promises to pay, on the Loan Maturity Date, and there shall become absolutely due and payable on the Loan Maturity Date, all of the Loans outstanding on such date, together with any and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that BGI, Barnes Germany, Barnes Luxembourg and/or Barnes Switzerland, as the case may be, shall repay each Swing Line Loan on the earlier to occur of (i) the date ten (10) Business Days after such Loan is made and (ii) the Loan Maturity Date.
3.2Mandatory Repayments of Loans. If at any time (a) the sum of the outstanding amount of the Loans, the Maximum Drawing Amount and all Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations exceeds the Total Commitment at such time or (b) the sum of the outstanding amount of all Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies exceeds the Alternative Currency Sublimit at such time, then BGI shall immediately pay or (solely in the case of the Barnes Germany Loans) shall cause Barnes Germany to pay or (solely in the case of the Barnes Luxembourg Loans) shall cause Barnes Luxembourg to pay or (solely in the case of the Barnes Switzerland Loans) shall cause Barnes Switzerland to pay the amount of such excess to the Administrative Agent for the respective accounts of the Lenders for application: first, to any Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations; second, to the Loans; and third, to Cash Collateralize the Reimbursement Obligations. Subject to §5.14, each payment of any Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations or prepayment of Loans shall be applied to the Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations or the Loans of the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitment Percentages. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) any payments by Barnes Germany shall be applied solely to the Barnes Germany Loans or Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations or Reimbursement Obligations in respect of Letters of Credit issued for the account of Barnes Germany, (ii) any payments by Barnes Luxembourg shall be applied solely to the Barnes Luxembourg Loans or Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations or Reimbursement Obligations in respect of Letters of Credit issued for the account of Barnes Luxembourg, and (iii) any payments by Barnes Switzerland shall be applied solely to the Barnes Switzerland Loans or Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations or Reimbursement Obligations in respect of Letters of Credit issued for the account of Barnes Switzerland.

The applicable Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent, no later than 11:00 a.m. (Eastern time) (i) at least one (1) Business Day prior written notice of any proposed prepayment pursuant to this §3.3 of Base Rate Loans, (ii) at least three (3) Business Days’ notice of any proposed prepayment pursuant to this §3.3 of SOFR Loans, and (iii) at least four (4) Business Days (or five (5), in the case of prepayment of Loans denominated in Special Notice Currencies) written notice of any proposed prepayment pursuant to this §3.3 of Alternative Currency Loans, in each case specifying the proposed date of prepayment of Loans and the principal amount to be prepaid. Each such partial prepayment of the Loans shall be in an integral multiple of $1,000,000, shall be accompanied by the payment of accrued interest on the principal prepaid to the date of prepayment and shall be applied, in the absence of instruction by the applicable Borrower, first to the principal of Base Rate Loans and then to the principal of SOFR Loans and Alternative Currency Loans. Subject to §5.14, each such prepayment shall be applied to the Loans of the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitment Percentages.

(c)The Issuing Bank shall not be under any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if:
(i)any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the Issuing Bank from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to the Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the Issuing Bank shall prohibit, or request that the Issuing Bank refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the Issuing Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the Issuing Bank any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the date hereof and which the Issuing Bank in good faith deems material to it;

4.2Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; Auto-Extension Letters of Credit.
(a)Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of the applicable Borrower delivered to the Issuing Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the applicable Borrower. Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (Eastern time) at least two Business Days (or such later date and time as the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank may agree in a particular instance in their sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the Issuing Bank: (i) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (ii) the amount and currency thereof and in the absence of specification of currency shall be deemed a request for a Letter of Credit denominated in Dollars; (iii) the expiry date thereof; (iv) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (v) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (vi) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (vii) such other matters as the Issuing Bank may require. In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the Issuing Bank (w) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (x) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (y) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (z) such other matters as the Issuing Bank may require. Additionally, the applicable Borrower shall furnish to the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent such other documents and information pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit issuance or amendment, including any Issuer Documents, as the Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent may require.
(b)Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application at the address set forth in §16.6 for receiving Letter of Credit Applications and related correspondence, the Issuing Bank will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Application from the applicable Borrower and, if not, the Issuing Bank will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Unless the Issuing Bank has received written notice from any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any Loan Party, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions in §12 shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Issuing Bank shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the applicable Borrower (or the applicable Subsidiary) or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with the Issuing Bank’s usual and customary business practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Issuing Bank a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lender’s Commitment Percentage times the amount of such Letter of Credit.




DB3/ 204224713.6

52

(c)Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the Issuing Bank will also deliver to the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment.
(d)If any Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole and absolute discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an “Auto-Extension Letter of Credit”); provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit the Issuing Bank to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the “Non-Extension Notice Date”) in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the Issuing Bank, no Borrower shall be required to make a specific request to the Issuing Bank for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the Issuing Bank to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date; provided, however, that the Issuing Bank shall not permit any such extension if (A) the Issuing Bank has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of clause (b) or (c) of §4.1 or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is five Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the applicable Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in §12 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing the Issuing Bank not to permit such extension.
(e)The Administrative Agent will notify the Lenders, on a quarterly basis, of all Letters of Credit outstanding.
4.3Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.
(a)Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank shall notify the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof. In the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the applicable Borrower shall reimburse the Issuing Bank in such Alternative Currency, unless (i) the Issuing Bank (at its option) shall have specified in such notice that it will require reimbursement in Dollars, or (ii) in the absence of any such requirement for reimbursement in Dollars, the applicable Borrower shall have notified the Issuing Bank promptly following receipt of the notice of drawing that the applicable Borrower will reimburse the Issuing Bank in Dollars. In the case of any such reimbursement in Dollars of a drawing under a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the Issuing Bank shall notify the applicable Borrower of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the drawing promptly following the determination thereof. Not later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of any payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in Dollars, or the Applicable Time on the date of any payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in an Alternative Currency (each such date, an “Honor Date”), the applicable Borrower shall reimburse the Issuing Bank through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing and in the applicable currency. In the event that (A) a drawing denominated in an Alternative Currency is to be reimbursed in Dollars pursuant to the second sentence in this §4.3(a) and (B) the
DB3/ 204224713.6

53

Dollar amount paid by the applicable Borrower, whether on or after the Honor Date, shall not be adequate on the date of that payment to purchase in accordance with normal banking procedures a sum denominated in the Alternative Currency equal to the drawing, the applicable Borrower agrees, as a separate and independent obligation, to indemnify the Issuing Bank for the loss resulting from its inability on that date to purchase the Alternative Currency in the full amount of the drawing. If the applicable Borrower fails to so reimburse the Issuing Bank by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the Unpaid Reimbursement Obligation (expressed in Dollars in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent thereof in the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency), and the amount of such Lender’s Commitment Percentage thereof. In such event, the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Credit Loan which is a Base Rate Loan to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unpaid Reimbursement Obligation, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in §2.6 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Total Commitment and the conditions set forth in §12 (other than the delivery of a Loan Request). Any notice given by the Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this §4.3(a) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.
(b)Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to §4.3(a) make funds available (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral provided for this purpose) to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank, in Dollars, at the Administrative Agent’s Office for Dollar-denominated payments in an amount equal to its Commitment Percentage of the Unpaid Reimbursement Obligation not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of 4.3(c), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Revolving Credit Loan which is a Base Rate Loan to the applicable Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Issuing Bank in Dollars.
(c)With respect to any Unpaid Reimbursement Obligation that is not fully refinanced by a Revolving Credit Loan which is a Base Rate Loan because the conditions set forth in §12 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the Issuing Bank a Letter of Credit Borrowing in the amount of the Unpaid Reimbursement Obligation that is not so refinanced, which Letter of Credit Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the rate set forth for Base Rate Loans in §6.11. In such event, each Lender’s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank pursuant to §4.3(b) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such Letter of Credit Borrowing and shall constitute a Letter of Credit Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this §4.3.








DB3/ 204224713.6

54

(d)Until each Lender funds its Revolving Credit Loan which is a Base Rate Loan or Letter of Credit Advance pursuant to this §4.3 to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender’s Commitment Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the Issuing Bank.
(e)Each Lender’s obligation to make a Revolving Credit Loan which is a Base Rate Loan or Letter of Credit Advances to reimburse the Issuing Bank for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this §4.3, shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Issuing Bank, the applicable Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (iii) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Lender’s obligation to make a Revolving Credit Loan which is a Base Rate Loan pursuant to this §4.3 is subject to the conditions set forth in §12 (other than delivery by the applicable Borrower of a Loan Request). No such making of a Letter of Credit Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the applicable Borrower to reimburse the Issuing Bank for the amount of any payment made by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.
(f)If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this §4.3 by the time specified in §4.3(b), the Issuing Bank shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Issuing Bank at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Issuing Bank in connection with the foregoing. A certificate of the Issuing Bank submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
4.4Repayment of Participations.
(a)At any time after the Issuing Bank has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such Lender’s Letter of Credit Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with §4.3, if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of the Issuing Bank any payment in respect of the related Unpaid Reimbursement Obligation or interest thereon (whether directly from the applicable Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Commitment Percentage thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender’s Letter of Credit Advance was outstanding) in Dollars and in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent.





DB3/ 204224713.6

55

(b)If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank pursuant to §4.3(a) is required to be returned in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Issuing Bank in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank its Commitment Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Credit Agreement.
4.5Obligations Absolute.
The obligation of the applicable Borrower to reimburse the Issuing Bank for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each Letter of Credit Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Credit Agreement under all circumstances, including the following:
(a)any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Credit Agreement, or any other Loan Document;
(b)the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that any Borrower or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the Issuing Bank or any other Person, whether in connection with this Credit Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction;
(c)any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit;
(d)any payment by the Issuing Bank under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the Issuing Bank under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law;









DB3/ 204224713.6

56

(e)any adverse change in the relevant exchange rates or in the availability of the relevant Alternative Currency to any Borrower or any Subsidiary or in the relevant currency markets generally;
(f)any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Borrower or any Subsidiary; or
(g)any adverse change in the relevant exchange rates or in the availability of the relevant Alternative Currency to the Borrowers or any Subsidiary or in the relevant currency markets generally.
The applicable Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with the applicable Borrower’s instructions or other irregularity, the applicable Borrower will immediately notify the Issuing Bank. The applicable Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the Issuing Bank and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.
4.6Role of Issuing Bank.
Each Lender and each of the Borrowers agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the Issuing Bank shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document. Each Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude such Borrower from pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the Issuing Bank, shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (a) through (e) of §4.5; provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the applicable Borrower may have a claim against the Issuing Bank, and the Issuing Bank may be liable to the applicable Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by such Borrower which such Borrower proves were caused by the Issuing Bank’s willful misconduct or gross negligence or the Issuing Bank’s willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the Issuing Bank shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.

4.7Applicability of ISP.
Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the Issuing Bank and the applicable Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued (including any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit), the rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit.
4.8Letter of Credit Amounts.
Unless otherwise specified herein the amount of a Letter of Credit at any time shall be deemed to be the Maximum Drawing Amount of such Letter of Credit in effect at such time; provided, however, that with respect to any Letter of Credit that, by its terms or the terms of any Issuer Document related thereto, provides for one or more automatic increases in the Maximum Drawing Amount thereof, the Maximum Drawing Amount of such Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be the maximum drawing amount of such Letter of Credit after giving effect to all such increases, whether or not such maximum drawing amount is in effect at such time.
4.9Letter of Credit Fee. The applicable Borrower shall pay (a) a fee (the “Letter of Credit Fee”) equal to the Applicable Margin on the Maximum Drawing Amount of the Letters of Credit (other than Performance Letters of Credit), in Dollars, to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, to be shared pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitment Percentages and (b) a fee equal to one-half of the Applicable Margin on the Maximum Drawing Amount of the Performance Letters of Credit (the “Performance Letter of Credit Fee”, collectively with the Letter of Credit Fee, the “Letter of Credit Fees”) to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, to be shared pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitment Percentages; provided, however, any Letter of Credit Fees otherwise payable for the account of a Defaulting Lender with respect to any Letter of Credit as to which such Defaulting Lender has not provided Cash Collateral satisfactory to the Issuing Bank pursuant to this §4.9 shall be payable, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, to the other Lenders in accordance with the upward adjustments in their respective Commitment Percentages allocable to such Letter of Credit pursuant to §5.14.1(d), with the balance of such fee, if any, payable to the Issuing Bank for its own account. The Letter of Credit Fees shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the first day following the end of each calendar quarter for the quarter just ended, with the first such payment commencing on the first such date following the date hereof, and on the Loan Maturity Date. In addition, a fronting fee equal to the percentage separately agreed upon in a letter between the applicable Borrower and the applicable Issuing Bank, computed on the amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit shall be payable quarterly in arrears by the applicable Borrower to such Issuing Bank for its account in accordance with the terms of such letter, and the applicable Borrower shall pay to such Issuing Bank any amendment, negotiation or document examination and other administrative fees charged by such Issuing Bank in connection with Letters of Credit as in effect from time to time.

5.CERTAIN GENERAL PROVISIONS.
5.1Administrative Agent’s Fee. BGI shall pay to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Agent’s fee (the “Administrative Agent’s Fee”) in such amount and at such times as set forth in the Fee Letter.
5.2Funds for Payments. Except with respect to principal of and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, all payments of principal, interest, Reimbursement Obligations, Fees and any other amounts due hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents shall be made on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent in Dollars, for the respective accounts of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, at the Administrative Agent’s Office or at such other place that the Administrative Agent may from time to time designate, in each case at or about 11:00 a.m. (Eastern time or other local time at the place of payment) and in Same Day Funds. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder with respect to principal and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent’s Office in such Alternative Currency and in Same Day Funds not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent on the dates specified herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this Credit Agreement be made in the United States. If, for any reason, any Borrower is prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency, such Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative Currency payment amount. All payments to be made by the Borrowers shall be made free and clear of and without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.
5.3Computations; Retroactive Adjustments of Applicable Margin.
(a)Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all computations of interest, and, the Facility Fee, the Letter of Credit Fees or other fees shall be based on a 360-day year and paid for the actual number of days elapsed, except that computations based on the Base Rate shall be based on a 365 or 366, as applicable, day year and paid for the actual number of days elapsed, and computations of interest in respect of Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies as to which market practices differ from the foregoing, shall be made in accordance with such market practice. Whenever a payment hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents becomes due on a day that is not a Business Day, the due date for such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and interest shall accrue during such extension; provided, that for any Interest Period for any Term SOFR Loan or Alternative Currency Term Rate Loan if such next succeeding Business Day falls in the next succeeding calendar month or after the Loan Maturity Date, it shall be deemed to end on the next preceding Business Day.
(b)If, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of BGI or its Subsidiaries resulting from the error of BGI or its Subsidiaries, including any of their agents or advisors, BGI or the Lenders determine that (i) the Leverage Ratio as calculated by BGI as of any applicable date was inaccurate and (ii) a proper calculation of the Leverage Ratio would have resulted in higher pricing for such period, the Borrowers shall immediately and retroactively be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders, promptly on demand by the Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Borrowers under any Debtor Relief Law, automatically and without further action by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank), an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that
DB3/ 204224713.6

59

should have been paid for the applicable period of such inaccuracy over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period. This paragraph shall not limit the rights of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, under §§4.3(c), 4.9 or 5.10 or under Article 13. The Borrowers’ obligations under this paragraph shall survive the termination of the Commitments and the repayment of all other Obligations hereunder.
5.4Inability to Determine Rates.
5.4.1.If in connection with any request for a borrowing, conversion or continuation of any Loans, as applicable, (i) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that (A) no Successor Rate for the Relevant Rate with respect to a proposed Loan denominated in an Agreed Currency has been determined in accordance with §5.4.2 and the circumstances under clause (i) of §5.4.2 or the Scheduled Unavailability Date has occurred with respect to such Relevant Rate (as applicable), or (B) adequate and reasonable means do not otherwise exist for determining the Relevant Rate for the applicable Agreed Currency for any determination date(s) or requested Interest Period, as applicable, with respect to an existing or proposed Loan, or (ii) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders determine that for any reason that the Relevant Rate with respect to a proposed Loan denominated in an Agreed Currency for any requested Interest Period or determination date(s) does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify BGI and each Lender.
Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make, maintain, continue or convert Loans in the affected currencies, as applicable, shall be suspended in each case to the extent of the affected Loans or Interest Period or determination date(s), as applicable, and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the utilization of Term SOFR component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a determination by the Required Lenders described in clause (ii) of this §5.4.1, until the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice.
Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the applicable Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, continuation of, or conversion to SOFR Loans or Alternative Currency Loans to the extent of the affected Loans or Interest Period or determination date(s), as applicable or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a borrowing of Base Rate Loans denominated in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the amount specified therein and (ii) (A) any outstanding SOFR Loans shall be deemed to have been converted to Base Rate Loans (1) immediately, in the case of a Daily SOFR Loan or (2) at the end of the applicable Interest Period, in the case of a Term SOFR Loan and (B) any outstanding affected Alternative Currency Loans, at the applicable Borrower’s election, shall either (1) be converted into a borrowing of Base Rate Loans denominated in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of such outstanding Alternative Currency Loan immediately, in the case of an Alternative Currency Daily Rate Loan or at the end of the applicable Interest Period, in the case of an Alternative Currency Term Rate Loan or (2) be prepaid in full immediately, in the case of an Alternative Currency Daily Rate Loan, or at the end of the applicable Interest Period, in the case of an Alternative Currency Term Rate Loan; provided that if no election is made by the applicable Borrower (x) in the case of an Alternative Currency Daily Rate Loan, by the date that is three Business Days after receipt by the applicable Borrower of such notice or (y) in the case of an Alternative Currency Term Rate Loan, by the last day of the current Interest Period for the applicable Alternative Currency Term Rate Loan, the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have elected clause (1) above.

5.4.2.Replacement of Relevant Rate or Successor Rate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Credit Agreement or any other Loan Documents, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or BGI or the Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the Required Lenders, a copy to BGI) that BGI or the Required Lenders (as applicable) have determined, that:
(a)adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Relevant Rate for an Agreed Currency because none of the tenors of such Relevant Rate (including any forward-looking term rate thereof) is available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or
(b)the Applicable Authority has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which all tenors of the Relevant Rate for an Agreed Currency (including any forward-looking term rate thereof) shall or will no longer be representative or made available, or used for determining the interest rate of loans denominated in such Agreed Currency, or shall or will otherwise cease, provided that, in each case, at the time of such statement, there is no successor administrator that is satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that will continue to provide such representative tenor(s) of the Relevant Rate for such Agreed Currency (the latest date on which all tenors of the Relevant Rate for such Agreed Currency (including any forward-looking term rate thereof) are no longer representative or available permanently or indefinitely, the “Scheduled Unavailability Date”); or
(c)syndicated loans currently being executed and agented in the U.S. are being executed or amended (as applicable) to incorporate or adopt a new benchmark interest rate to replace the Relevant Rate for an Agreed Currency;
or if the events or circumstances of the type described in §5.4.2(a), (b) or (c) have occurred with respect to the Successor Rate then in effect, then, the Administrative Agent and BGI may amend this Credit Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing the Relevant Rate for an Agreed Currency or any then current Successor Rate for an Agreed Currency in accordance with this §5.4 with (x) in the case of Term SOFR, Daily SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment, and (y) in the case of (i) Term SOFR, if the Administrative Agent determines that Daily SOFR is not available, or (ii) any other Relevant Rate, an alternative benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar credit facilities syndicated and agented in the U.S. and denominated in such Agreed Currency for such alternative benchmarks, and, in each case, including any mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar credit facilities syndicated and agented in the U.S. and denominated in such Agreed Currency for such benchmarks, which adjustment or method for calculating such adjustment shall be published on an information service as selected by the Administrative Agent from time to time in its reasonable discretion and may be periodically updated (any such proposed rate, including for the avoidance of doubt, any adjustment thereto, a “Successor Rate”), and any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and BGI unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders object to such amendment.




DB3/ 204224713.6

61

The Administrative Agent will promptly (in one or more notices) notify BGI and each Lender of the implementation of any Successor Rate.
Any Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice; provided that to the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent, such Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent.
Notwithstanding anything else herein, if at any time any Successor Rate as so determined would otherwise be less than zero, the Successor Rate will be deemed to be zero for the purposes of this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
In connection with the implementation of a Successor Rate, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes (in consultation with BGI) from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Credit Agreement; provided that, with respect to any such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to BGI and the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective.
5.5Illegality. (a) If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to a Relevant Rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to engage in reverse repurchase of U.S. Treasury securities transactions of the type included in the determination of SOFR, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon a Relevant Rate or to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, any Alternative Currency in the applicable interbank market, then, upon written notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrowers (through the Administrative Agent), (a) any obligation of such Lender to make, maintain, continue or convert Loans in the affected currency or currencies, shall be, in each case, suspended, and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrowers shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the












DB3/ 204224713.6

62

Administrative Agent), prepay all SOFR Loans or Alternative Currency Loans, as applicable, in the affected currency or currencies or, if applicable and such Loans are denominated in Dollars, convert all SOFR Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate), in each case, immediately, or, in the case of Term SOFR Loans and Alternative Currency Term Rate Loans, on the last day of the Interest Period therefor if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loans or Alternative Currency Term Rate Loans to such day and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon SOFR, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Term SOFR component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon SOFR. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
(b)Each Lender may at its option make any Loan to any Borrower by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the relevant Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Credit Agreement; provided, further, that notwithstanding which domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender makes such Loan to any Borrower, BGI shall only be required to repay such Loan to the Administrative Agent in the United States of America or the United Kingdom, Barnes Germany shall only be required to repay such Loans to the Administrative Agent in the United States of America, Germany or the United Kingdom, Barnes Luxembourg shall only be required to repay such Loans to the Administrative Agent in the United States of America, Luxembourg or the United Kingdom, and Barnes Switzerland shall only be required to repay such Loans to the Administrative Agent in the United States of America, Switzerland or the United Kingdom, in each case, otherwise in accordance with §5.2.
5.6Additional Costs, Etc. (a) General. If any Change in Law shall:
(i)impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement) or the Issuing Bank;
(ii)subject any Lender or the Issuing Bank to any Tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Credit Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any participation in a Letter of Credit or any Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender or the Issuing Bank in respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes, Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes, or Connection Income Taxes); or
(iii)impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the applicable interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Credit Agreement or Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or the Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or
DB3/ 204224713.6

63

receivable by such Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or the Issuing Bank, the Borrowers will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b)[Reserved.]
(c)Reserves on Loans. The applicable Borrower shall pay to each Lender, (i) as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including funds or deposits, additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), and (ii) as long as such Lender shall be required to comply with any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the maintenance of the Commitments or the funding of the Loans, such additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Commitment or Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which in each case shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan, provided the Borrowers shall have received at least ten (10) days’ prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest or costs from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice ten (10) days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable ten (10) days from receipt of such notice.
5.7Capital Adequacy. If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the Issuing Bank or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Credit Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity) then such Lender or the Administrative Agent may notify the Borrowers of such fact in writing. To the extent that the amount of such reduction in the return on capital is not reflected in the Base Rate, BGI agrees to pay or, solely in the case of the Barnes Germany Loans, Barnes Germany agrees to pay or, solely in the case of the Barnes Luxembourg Loans, Barnes Luxembourg agrees to pay or, solely in the case of the Barnes Switzerland Loans, Barnes Switzerland agrees to pay, such Lender or (as the case may be) the Administrative Agent for the amount of such reduction in the return on capital as and when such reduction is determined within 30 days of presentation by such Lender or (as the case may be) the Administrative Agent of a certificate in accordance with §5.8 hereof. Each Lender shall allocate such cost increases among its customers in good faith and on an equitable basis.





DB3/ 204224713.6

64

5.8Certificate. A certificate setting forth any additional amounts payable pursuant to §§5.6 or 5.7 showing the calculation in reasonable detail, submitted by any Lender or the Administrative Agent to the Borrowers, shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, that such amounts are due and owing. The Lender or the Administrative Agent shall notify the applicable Borrower within 180 days after it becomes aware of the imposition of such additional amount or amounts; provided that if such Lender or the Administrative Agent fails to so notify such Borrower within such 180 day period, such Lender or the Administrative Agent shall not be entitled to claim any additional amount or amounts pursuant to this subsection for any period ending on a date which is prior to 180 days before such notification (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180 day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
5.9Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrowers shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:
(a)any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Daily SOFR Loan, Alternative Currency Daily Rate Loan, Overnight Rate Loan, or a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);
(b)any failure by the Borrowers (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Daily SOFR Loan, Alternative Currency Daily Rate Loan, Overnight Rate Loan, or a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrowers;
(c)any assignment of a Term SOFR Loan or Alternative Currency Term Rate Loans on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by a Borrower pursuant to §5.11; or
(d)any failure by any Borrower to make payment of any Loan or drawing under any Letter of Credit (or interest due thereon) denominated in an Alternative Currency on its scheduled due date or any payment thereof in a different currency;

















DB3/ 204224713.6

65

including any loss of anticipated profits, any foreign exchange losses and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the performance of any foreign exchange contract. The Borrowers shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.
For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrowers to the Lenders under this §5.9, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Term SOFR Loan or Alternative Currency Term Rate made by it at the Relevant Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the applicable interbank market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Term SOFR Loan or Alternative Currency Term Rate was in fact so funded.
5.10Interest After Default.
5.10.1.Overdue Amounts. Overdue principal on the Loans and (to the extent permitted by applicable law) overdue interest on the Loans and all other overdue amounts payable hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents shall bear interest, payable on demand, at a rate per annum equal to two percent (2%) above the rate of interest then applicable thereto (or, if no rate of interest is then applicable thereto, two percent (2%) above the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin), including (without duplication) any Applicable Margin, until such amount shall be paid in full (after as well as before judgment).
5.10.2.Amounts Not Overdue. During the continuance of an Event of Default the principal of the Loans not overdue shall, until such Event of Default has been cured or remedied or such Event of Default has been waived by the Required Lenders pursuant to §16.12, shall, upon written notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, bear interest, payable on demand, at a rate per annum equal to two percent (2%) above the rate of interest then applicable thereto (or, if no rate of interest is then applicable thereto, two percent (2%) above the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin), including (without duplication) any Applicable Margin.
5.11Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
5.11.1.Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests compensation under §§5.6 or 5.7, or a Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender, the Issuing Bank, or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to §5.12, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to §5.5, then such Lender or the Issuing Bank shall, as applicable, use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender or the Issuing Bank, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to §§5.6, 5.7 or 5.12, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to §§5.5, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be. The Borrowers hereby agree to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender or the Issuing Bank in connection with any such designation or assignment.



DB3/ 204224713.6

5.11.2.Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender (an “Affected Lender”) (a) makes demand upon the Borrowers for (or if the Borrowers are otherwise required to pay) amounts pursuant to §§5.6 or 5.7, (b) is unable to make or maintain Loans as a result of a condition described in §5.5 or (c) is a Defaulting Lender, or if any other circumstance exists that gives the Borrowers express right to replace a Lender hereunder, the Borrowers may, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing, within ninety (90) days of (i) receipt of such demand, notice (or the occurrence of such other event causing the Borrowers to be required to pay such compensation or causing §5.5 to be applicable), or (ii) such default or circumstance giving the Borrowers such express right to replace a Lender hereunder, as the case may be, by notice (a “Replacement Notice”) in writing to the Administrative Agent and such Affected Lender (i) request the Affected Lender to cooperate with the Borrowers in obtaining a replacement Lender satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers (the “Replacement Lender”); (ii) request the non-Affected Lenders to acquire and assume all of the Affected Lender’s Loans and Commitment as provided herein, but none of such Lenders shall be under an obligation to do so; or (iii) designate a Replacement Lender approved by the Administrative Agent, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If any satisfactory Replacement Lender shall be obtained, and/or if any one or more of the non-Affected Lenders shall agree to acquire and assume all of the Affected Lender’s Loans and Commitment, then such Affected Lender shall assign, in accordance with §15, all of its Commitment, Loans, Letter of Credit Participations, Notes and other rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement and all other Loan Documents to such Replacement Lender or non-Affected Lenders, as the case may be, in exchange for payment of the principal amount so assigned and all interest and fees accrued on the amount so assigned, plus all other Obligations then due and payable to the Affected Lender; provided, however, that (A) such assignment shall be without recourse, representation or warranty and shall be on terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to such Affected Lender and such Replacement Lender and/or non-Affected Lenders, as the case may be, and (B) prior to any such assignment, the applicable Borrower shall have paid to such Affected Lender all amounts properly demanded and unreimbursed under §§5.6 and 5.7. Upon the effective date of such assignment, the Borrowers shall issue replacement Notes to such Replacement Lender and/or non-Affected Lenders, as the case may be, and such institution shall become a “Lender” for all purposes under this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
5.12Taxes.
5.12.1.Payments Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Payments on Account of Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall to the extent permitted by applicable Laws be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes. If, however, applicable Laws (in the good faith determination of any Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as applicable) require any Borrower or the Administrative Agent to withhold or deduct any Tax, such Tax shall be withheld or deducted in accordance with such Laws as determined by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, upon the basis of the information and documentation to be delivered pursuant to subsection (e) below.

70

(iii)any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Credit Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent), executed copies (or originals, as required) of any other form prescribed by applicable Laws as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Laws to permit such Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
(iv)if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to BGI and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by BGI or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by BGI or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for BGI and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Credit Agreement.
(c)Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this §5.21 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify BGI and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
(d)Each Lender shall promptly (A) notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction, and (B) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws of any jurisdiction that the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent make any withholding or deduction for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender.

5.12.6.Treatment of Certain Refunds. Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Bank, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender or the Issuing Bank, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be. If the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Borrower or with respect to which such Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this §5.12, it shall pay to such Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower under this §5.12 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that such Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank in the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as applicable, be required to pay any amount to such Loan Party pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as applicable, in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Loan Party or any other Person.
5.12.7.Survival. Each party’s obligations under this §5.12 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments, the expiration or cancellation of all Letters of Credit and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.

5.13Cash Collateral.
5.13.1.Certain Credit Support Events. Upon the request of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank (i) if the Issuing Bank has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in a Letter of Credit Borrowing and an Event of Default exists, the applicable Borrower shall immediately Cash Collateralize the then outstanding amount of all Letter of Credit Obligations, or (ii) if, as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date with respect to any Letter of Credit, any Letter of Credit Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, the applicable Borrower shall immediately Cash Collateralize the then outstanding amount of any Letter of Credit Obligations in respect of all Letters of Credit expiring on such Letter of Credit Expiration Date. Upon the request of the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, if an Event of Default exists, the Borrowers shall Cash Collateralize the then outstanding amount of Letter of Credit Obligations (if any). At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, immediately upon the request of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swing Line Lender, the Borrowers shall deliver to the Administrative Agent Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to cover all Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to §5.14.1(d) and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).
5.13.2.Grant of Security Interest. All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in one or more blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts with the Administrative Agent. The Borrowers, and to the extent provided by any Lender, such Lender, hereby grants to (and subjects to the control of) the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders (including the Swing Line Lender), and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein, and all other property so provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to §5.13.3. If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the applicable Fronting Exposure and other obligations secured thereby, the Borrowers or the relevant Defaulting Lender will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency.
5.13.3.Application. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Credit Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under any of this §5.13 or §§4 or 5.14 in respect of Letters of Credit or Swing Line Loans shall be held and applied to the satisfaction of the specific Letter of Credit Obligations, Swing Line Loans, obligations to fund participations therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) and other obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may be provided for herein.








DB3/ 204224713.6

73

5.13.4.Release. Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce Fronting Exposure shall be released promptly following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure giving rise thereto (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with §15.1.1(d))) or (ii) the Administrative Agent’s good faith determination that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided, however, (x) that Cash Collateral furnished by or on behalf of a Loan Party shall not be released during the continuance of a Default or Event of Default, and (y) the Person providing Cash Collateral and the Issuing Bank or Swing Line Lender, as applicable, may agree that Cash Collateral shall not be released but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure.
5.14Defaulting Lenders.
5.14.1.Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Credit Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law:
(a)Waivers and Amendments. That Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Credit Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in §16.12.
(b)Reallocation of Payments. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of that Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to §13 or otherwise, and including any amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by that Defaulting Lender pursuant to §16.1), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the Issuing Bank or Swing Line Lender hereunder; third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent or requested by the Issuing Bank or Swing Line Lender, to be held as Cash Collateral for future funding obligations of that Defaulting Lender of any participation in any Swing Line Loan or Letter of Credit; fourth, as the Borrowers may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Credit Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers, to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of that Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Credit Agreement; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the Issuing Bank or Swing Line Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the Issuing Bank or Swing Line Lender against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Credit Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrowers as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Borrower against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Credit Agreement; and eighth, to that Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or Letter of Credit Borrowings in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y) such Loans or Letter of Credit Borrowings were made at a time when the conditions set forth in §12 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and Letter of Credit Borrowings owed to, all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis
DB3/ 204224713.6

74

prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or Letter of Credit Borrowings owed to, that Defaulting Lender. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this §5.14.1(b) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
(c)Certain Fees. That Defaulting Lender (x) shall be entitled to receive any Facility Fee pursuant to §2.2 for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to extent allocable to the sum of (1) the outstanding amount of the Loans funded by it and (2) its Commitment Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to §§4, 5.13 or §5.14.1(b), as applicable (and the Borrowers shall (A) be required to pay to each of the Issuing Bank and the Swing Line Lender, as applicable, the amount of such fee allocable to its Fronting Exposure arising from that Defaulting Lender and (B) not be required to pay the remaining amount of such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender) and (y) shall be limited in its right to receive Letter of Credit Fees as provided in §4.9.
(d)Reallocation of Applicable Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure. During any period in which there is a Defaulting Lender, for purposes of computing the amount of the obligation of each non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, refinance or fund Loans, participations in Letters of Credit or Swing Line Loans pursuant to §§2, 2.6.2 and 4, the “Commitment Percentage” of each non-Defaulting Lender shall be computed without giving effect to the Commitment of that Defaulting Lender; provided that, (i) each such reallocation shall be given effect only if, at the date the applicable Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, no Default or Event of Default exists; and (ii) the aggregate obligation of each non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, refinance or fund Loans, participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans shall not exceed the positive difference, if any, of (1) the Commitment of that non-Defaulting Lender minus (2) the aggregate outstanding amount of the Loans of that Lender.
5.14.2.Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and the Issuing Bank agree in writing in their sole discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Commitment Percentages (without giving effect to §5.14.1(d)), whereupon that Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrowers while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.

Each Pension Plan that is intended to be a qualified plan under §401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that the form of such Plan is qualified under §401(a) of the Code and the trust related thereto has been determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be exempt from federal income tax under §501(a) of the Code, or an application for such a letter is currently being processed by the Internal Revenue Service, or such Pension Plan is maintained pursuant to prototype plan documents for which the prototype sponsor has received a favorable Internal Revenue Service opinion letter.

7.13.3.(i) No ERISA Event has occurred, and no Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate is aware of any fact, event or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to constitute or result in an ERISA Event with respect to any Pension Plan that (in any case) would result in an Event of Default; (ii) each Borrower and each ERISA Affiliate has met all applicable requirements under the Pension Funding Rules in respect of each Pension Plan, and no waiver of the minimum funding standards under the Pension Funding Rules has been applied for or obtained; (iii) as of the most recent valuation date for any Pension Plan, the funding target attainment percentage (as defined in §430(d)(2) of the Code) is 60% or higher and no Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate knows of any facts or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to cause the funding target attainment percentage for any such plan to drop below 60% as of the most recent valuation date; (iv) no Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in a transaction that could be subject to §4069 or §4212(c) of ERISA, (v) no Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability to the PBGC other than for the payment of premiums, and there are no premium payments which have become due that are unpaid; and (vi) no Pension Plan has been terminated by the plan administrator thereof nor by the PBGC, and no event or circumstance has occurred or exists that could reasonably be expected to cause the PBGC to institute proceedings under Title IV of ERISA to terminate any Pension Plan.

Notwithstanding the foregoing §10.3, if, at any time, the 2014 BGI Note Purchase Agreement is amended to include a senior leverage ratio as then applicable (the “2014 BGI NPA Senior Leverage Ratio”) that is more restrictive than the Senior Leverage Ratio contained in §10.3, then the Borrowers shall provide notice with a certified copy of such amendment to the Administrative Agent. Upon receipt of such notice, the Senior Leverage Ratio permitted by §10.3 shall be deemed to be automatically amended to be as restrictive as the 2014 BGI NPA Senior Leverage Ratio at such time notwithstanding §16.12. If, at any time when such an automatic amendment is in effect, the 2014 BGI NPA Senior Leverage Ratio is amended to be made less restrictive, the Borrowers shall provide notice with a certified copy of such amendment to the Administrative Agent. Upon receipt of such notice, the Senior Leverage Ratio required by §10.3 shall be deemed automatically amended herein to reflect such less restrictive 2014 BGI NPA Senior Leverage Ratio without any further action by any party hereto notwithstanding §16.12; provided, that no such automatic amendment shall cause the maximum Senior Leverage Ratio under §10.3 to exceed 3.75:1.00, as then applicable.

Each of the representations and warranties of any of the Borrowers contained in this Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents or in any document or instrument delivered pursuant to or in connection with this Credit Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects (other than any representation and warranty that is expressly qualified by materiality, in which case such representation and warranty shall be true and correct in all respects), as of the date as of which they were made and shall also be true and correct in all such material respects at and as of the time of the making of such Loan or the issuance, extension or renewal of such Letter of Credit, with the same effect as if made at and as of that time (except to the extent of changes resulting from transactions contemplated or permitted by this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents and changes occurring in the ordinary course of business that singly or in the aggregate have not resulted and would not be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect, and to the extent that such representations and warranties relate expressly to an earlier date) and no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.
12.2No Legal Impediment. No change shall have occurred in any law or regulations thereunder or interpretations thereof that in the reasonable opinion of any Lender would make it illegal for such Lender to make such Loan or to participate in the issuance, extension or renewal of such Letter of Credit or in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent would make it illegal for the applicable Issuing Bank to issue, extend or renew such Letter of Credit.

DB3/ 204224713.6

104

Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any instrument pursuant to which the Obligations to such Lender are evidenced, including as permitted by applicable law the obtaining of the ex parte appointment of a receiver, and, if such amount shall have become due, by declaration or otherwise, proceed to enforce the payment thereof or any other legal or equitable right of such Lender. No remedy herein conferred upon any Lender or the Administrative Agent or the holder of any Note or purchaser of any Letter of Credit Participation is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy and each and every remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or any other provision of law.
14.THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.
14.1Authorization.
(a)Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoints Bank of America to act on its behalf as Administrative Agent hereunder and under any of the other Loan Documents and any related documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incident thereto, provided that no duties or responsibilities not expressly assumed herein or therein shall be implied to have been assumed by the Administrative Agent.
(b)The relationship between the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders is that of an independent contractor. The use of the term “Administrative Agent” is for convenience only and is used to describe, as a form of convention, the independent contractual relationship between the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders. Nothing contained in this Credit Agreement nor the other Loan Documents shall be construed to create an agency, trust or other fiduciary relationship between the Administrative Agent and any of the Lenders;
(c)As an independent contractor empowered by the Lenders to exercise certain rights and perform certain duties and responsibilities hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent is nevertheless a “representative” of the Lenders, as that term is defined in Article 1 of the Uniform Commercial Code, for purposes of actions for the benefit of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent with respect to all collateral security and guaranties contemplated by the Loan Documents. Such actions include the designation of the Administrative Agent as “secured party”, “mortgagee” or the like on all financing statements and other documents and instruments, whether recorded or otherwise, relating to the attachment, perfection, priority or enforcement of any security interests, mortgages or deeds of trust in collateral security intended to secure the payment or performance of any of the Obligations, all for the benefit of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent.
(d)The Issuing Bank shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and the Issuing Bank shall have all the benefits and immunities (i) provided to the Administrative Agent in this §14 with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by the Issuing Bank in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and the applications and agreements for letters of credit pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term “Administrative Agent” as used in this §14 included the Issuing Bank with respect to such acts or omissions (and including any affiliates of the Issuing Bank and the officers, directors, employees, agents and attorneys-in-fact of the Issuing
DB3/ 204224713.6

105

Bank and any affiliates), and (ii) as additionally provided herein with respect to the Issuing Bank.
(e)The provisions of this §14 are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, and none of the Borrowers nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions.
14.2Employees and Administrative Agents. The Administrative Agent may exercise its powers and execute its duties by or through employees or agents and shall be entitled to take, and to rely on, advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to its rights and duties under this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents. The Administrative Agent may utilize the services of such Persons as the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion may reasonably determine, and all reasonable fees and expenses of any such Persons shall be paid by the Borrowers.
14.3No Liability. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its shareholders, directors, officers or employees nor any other Person assisting them in their duties nor any agent or employee thereof, shall be liable for any waiver, consent or approval given or any action taken, or omitted to be taken, in good faith by it or them hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, or in connection herewith or therewith, or be responsible for the consequences of any oversight or error of judgment whatsoever, except that the Administrative Agent or such other Person, as the case may be, may be liable for losses due to its bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability to any Lender for relying upon, any writing, communication, signature, resolution, representation, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex, electronic mail message, statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. With respect to the Lenders, the Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under any Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action; provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law; provided further that, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action (other than an action expressly required by this Credit Agreement to be taken by it under such circumstances) that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected, as against the Lenders, in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders (or such greater number of Lenders as may be expressly required hereby in any instance) and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders. Except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall have no duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrowers or any of their respective Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrowers or a Lender.

14.4No Representations.
14.4.1.General. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the execution or validity or enforceability of this Credit Agreement, the Notes, the Letters of Credit, any of the other Loan Documents or any instrument at any time constituting, or intended to constitute, collateral security for the Notes, or for the value of any such collateral security or for the validity, enforceability or collectability of any such amounts owing with respect to the Notes, or for any recitals or statements, warranties or representations made herein or in any of the other Loan Documents or in any certificate or instrument hereafter furnished to it by or on behalf of any of the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries, or be bound to ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions, covenants or agreements herein or to inspect any of the properties, books or records of any of the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries. The Administrative Agent shall not be bound to ascertain whether any notice, consent, waiver or request delivered to it by any of the Borrowers or any holder of any of the Notes shall have been duly authorized or is true, accurate and complete. The Administrative Agent has not made nor does it now make any representations or warranties, express or implied, nor does it assume any liability to the Lenders, with respect to the credit worthiness or financial conditions of any of the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based upon such information and documents as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Credit Agreement.
14.4.2.Closing Documentation, Etc. For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions set forth in §11, each Lender that has executed this Credit Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted, or to be satisfied with, each document and matter either sent, or made available, by the Administrative Agent or each Co-Lead Arranger to such Lender for consent, approval, acceptance or satisfaction, or required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to such Lender, unless an officer of the Administrative Agent or each Co-Lead Arranger acting upon any Borrower’s account shall have received notice from such Lender not less than three days prior to the Closing Date specifying such Lender’s objection thereto and such objection shall not have been withdrawn by notice to the Administrative Agent or each Co-Lead Arranger to such effect on or prior to the Closing Date.

107

14.5Payments.
14.5.1.Payments to Administrative Agent. A payment by any of the Borrowers to the Administrative Agent hereunder or any of the other Loan Documents for the account of any Lender shall constitute a payment to such Lender. The Administrative Agent agrees promptly to distribute to each Lender such Lender’s pro rata share of payments received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders except as otherwise expressly provided herein or in any of the other Loan Documents.
14.5.2.Distribution by Administrative Agent. If in the opinion of the Administrative Agent the distribution of any amount received by it in such capacity hereunder, under the Notes or under any of the other Loan Documents might involve it in liability, it may refrain from making distribution until its right to make distribution shall have been adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction. If a court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge that any amount received and distributed by the Administrative Agent is to be repaid, each Person to whom any such distribution shall have been made shall either repay to the Administrative Agent its proportionate share of the amount so adjudged to be repaid or shall pay over the same in such manner and to such Persons as shall be determined by such court.
14.6Holders of Notes. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note or the purchaser of any Letter of Credit Participation as the absolute owner or purchaser thereof for all purposes hereof until it shall have been furnished in writing with a different name by such payee or by a subsequent holder, assignee or transferee.
14.7Indemnity. To the extent not reimbursed by the Borrowers, the Lenders ratably agree hereby to indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates (including any of the officers, directors, employees, agents and attorneys-in-fact of any thereof) (each an “Indemnified Party”) from and against any and all claims, actions and suits (whether groundless or otherwise), losses, damages, costs, expenses (including any expenses for which such Indemnified Party has not been reimbursed by the Borrowers as required by §16.3), and liabilities of every nature and character arising out of or related to this Credit Agreement, the Notes, or any of the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated or evidenced hereby or thereby, or such Indemnified Party’s actions taken hereunder or thereunder, except to the extent that any of the same shall be directly caused by such Indemnified Party’s bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence, or, in the absence of instruction or concurrence of the Required Lenders, breach of contract.
14.8Administrative Agent as Lender, Etc. In its individual capacity, Bank of America shall have the same obligations and the same rights, powers and privileges in respect to its Commitment and the Loans made by it, and as the holder of any of the Notes and as the purchaser of any Letter of Credit Participations, as it would have were it not also the Administrative Agent. None of the Documentation Agent, Book Runners, Syndication Agents, or Co-Lead Arrangers shall have any obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents other than as a Lender hereunder.
14.9Resignation.






DB3/ 204224713.6

108

(a)The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrowers. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. Provided that no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, such successor Administrative Agent shall be reasonably acceptable to the Borrowers. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; provided that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrowers and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (x) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (y) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and the Issuing Bank directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this §14.9. Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this §14.9). The fees payable by the Borrowers to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrowers and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article 14 and §14.9 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.
(b)Any resignation by Bank of America as Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section shall also constitute its resignation as Issuing Bank and Swing Line Lender. Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Issuing Bank and Swing Line Lender, (b) the retiring Issuing Bank and Swing Line Lender shall be discharged from all of their respective duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, and (c) the successor Issuing Bank shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to the retiring Issuing Bank to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring Issuing Bank with respect to such Letters of Credit.

14.11Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim.
(a)In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial, administrative or like proceeding or any assignment for the benefit of creditors relative to any of the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan, Reimbursement Obligation or Unpaid Reimbursement Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on any of the Borrowers) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding, under any such assignment or otherwise:
(i)to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, Reimbursement Obligations or Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under the terms of this Credit Agreement) allowed in such proceeding or under any such assignment; and
(ii)to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
(b)Any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such proceeding or under any such assignment is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, nevertheless to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel due the Administrative Agent under the terms of this Credit Agreement, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under the terms of this Credit Agreement.
(c)Nothing contained herein shall authorize the Administrative Agent to consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations owed to such Lender or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding or under any such assignment.

14.12Recovery of Erroneous Payments. Without limitation of any other provision in this Credit Agreement, if at any time the Administrative Agent makes a payment hereunder in error to any Lender, whether or not in respect of an Obligation due and owing by any Borrower at such time, where such payment is a Rescindable Amount, then in any such event, each Lender receiving a Rescindable Amount severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the Rescindable Amount received by such Lender in Same Day Funds in the currency so received, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such Rescindable Amount is received by it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the applicable Overnight Rate. Each Lender irrevocably waives any and all defenses, including any “discharge for value” (under which a creditor might otherwise claim a right to retain funds mistakenly paid by a third party in respect of a debt owed by another) or similar defense to its obligation to return any Rescindable Amount.  The Administrative Agent shall inform each Lender promptly upon determining that any payment made to such Lender comprised, in whole or in part, a Rescindable Amount.
15.ASSIGNMENT AND PARTICIPATION.
15.1General Conditions and Conditions to Assignment. The provisions of this Credit Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that no Borrower may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of §15.1.1, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of §15.3, or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of §15.6 (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Credit Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in §15.3 and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Credit Agreement.
15.1.1.Assignments by Lenders. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans (including for purposes of this subsection (b), participations in Letter of Credit Obligations and in Swing Line Loans) at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions:

DB3/ 204224713.6

111

(ii)in any case not described in §15.1.1(a)(i), the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if “Trade Date” is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, BGI otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that concurrent assignments to members of an Assignee Group and concurrent assignments from members of an Assignee Group to a single Eligible Assignee (or to an Eligible Assignee and members of its Assignee Group) will be treated as a single assignment for purposes of determining whether such minimum amount has been met.
(b)Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause (b) shall not apply to rights in respect of the Swing Line Lender’s rights and obligations in respect of Swing Line Loans;
(c)Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by §15.1.1(a)(ii) and, in addition:
(i)the consent of BGI (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) shall be required unless (1) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (2) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; provided that BGI shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment with respect to any Loan unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within ten (10) Business Days after having received notice thereof;
(ii)the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender;
(iii)the consent of the Issuing Bank (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for any assignment; and

(e)No Assignment to Certain Persons. No such assignment shall be made (A) to any Borrower or any of their Affiliates, or (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B), or (C) to a natural person (or holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of a natural person).
(f)Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of BGI and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans in accordance with its Commitment Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Credit Agreement until such compliance occurs.
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to §15.3, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Credit Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Credit Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Credit Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of §§5.6, 5.7, 5.9, 5.12, 16.2 and 16.3 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. Upon request, the Borrowers (at their expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Credit Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Credit Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance §15.3.









DB3/ 204224713.6

113

15.2Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers (and such agency being solely for Tax purposes), shall maintain a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register or similar list (the “Register”) for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment Percentage of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to and Letter of Credit Participations purchased by, the Lenders from time to time. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Credit Agreement. In addition, the Administrative Agent shall maintain on the Register information regarding the designation, and revocation of designation, of any Lender as a Defaulting Lender. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers and the Lenders at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
15.3Participations. Each Lender may sell participations to one or more Persons (other than to a Defaulting Lender or a natural person (or holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of a natural person)) (each, a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents; provided that (a) except in the case of any such participation sold to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to a Lender, each such participation shall be in an amount of not less than $5,000,000, or shall be in an amount of such Lender’s entire remaining Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it, (b) any such sale or participation shall not affect the rights and duties of the selling Lender hereunder to the Borrowers, (c) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (d) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Bank shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Credit Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Credit Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver that would reduce the principal of or the interest rate on any Loans subject to such participation, extend the term or increase the amount of the Commitment of such Lender as it relates to such Participant, reduce the amount of any Facility Fee or Letter of Credit Fees or other fees to which such Participant is entitled, or extend any regularly scheduled payment date for principal or interest with respect to Loans subject to such participation. Subject to §15.4, the Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of §§5.6, 5.7, 5.9 and 5.12.1 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to §15.1. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of §16.1 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to §16.1 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrowers’ request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrowers to effectuate the provisions of §5.11 with respect to any Participant. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this
DB3/ 204224713.6

114

Credit Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
15.4Limitation upon Participant Rights. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under §§5.6, 5.7 and 5.12.1 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrowers’ prior written consent.
15.5Participant Affiliated with the Borrowers. If any Lender sells a participating interest in any of the Loans or Reimbursement Obligations to a Participant, and such Participant is any Borrower or an Affiliate of any Borrower, then such transferor Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of the sale of such participation. A transferor Lender shall have no right to vote as a Lender hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents for purposes of granting consents or waivers or for purposes of agreeing to amendments or modifications to any of the Loan Documents or for purposes of making requests to the Administrative Agent pursuant to §13.1 or §13.2 to the extent that such participation is beneficially owned by any Borrower or any Affiliate of any Borrower, and the determination of the Required Lenders shall for all purposes of this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents be made without regard to the interest of such transferor Lender in the Loans or Reimbursement Obligations to the extent of such participation.
15.6Miscellaneous Assignment Provisions. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its interest and rights under this Credit Agreement (including all or any portion of its Notes) to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation (a) any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to any of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks organized under §4 of the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. §341 and (b) with respect to any Lender that is a fund that invests in bank loans, to any lender or any trustee for, or any other representative of, holders of obligations owed or securities issued by such fund as security for such obligations or securities or any institutional custodian for such fund or for such lender. Any foreclosure or similar action by any Person in respect of such pledge or assignment shall be subject to the other provisions of this §15. No such pledge or the enforcement thereof shall release the pledgor Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, provide any voting rights hereunder to the pledgee thereof, or affect any rights or obligations of the Borrowers or Administrative Agent hereunder.
15.7Resignation After Assignment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time Bank of America assigns all of its Commitment and Loans pursuant to §15.1, Bank of America may, (i) upon thirty (30) days’ notice to the Borrowers and the Lenders, resign as Issuing Bank and/or (ii) upon thirty (30) days’ notice to the Borrowers, resign as Swing Line Lender. In the event of any such resignation as Issuing Bank or Swing Line Lender, the Borrowers shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor Issuing Bank or Swing Line Lender hereunder (with the consent of such Lender being appointed as a successor Issuing Bank or Swing Line Lender); provided, however, that no failure by the Borrowers to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of Bank of America as Issuing Bank or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be. If Bank of America or any other Issuing Bank resigns as Issuing Bank, it shall retain all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as Issuing Bank and all Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations plus the Maximum Drawing Amount with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or make payments with respect to Reimbursement Obligations). If Bank of America or any other Swing Line Lender resigns as Swing Line Lender, it shall retain all the rights of the Swing Line Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swing Line Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require the Lenders

to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swing Line Loans pursuant to §2.9.

16.12Consents, Amendments, Waivers, Etc. Any consent or approval required or permitted by this Credit Agreement to be given by the Lenders may be given, and any term of this Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents or any other instrument related hereto or mentioned herein may be amended, and the performance or observance by any of the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries of any terms of this Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents or such other instrument or the continuance of any Default or Event of Default may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively) with, but only with, the written consent of the Borrowers and the written consent of the Required Lenders, and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent (which acknowledgement shall be promptly provided if the Required Lenders have provided consent). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment, modification or waiver shall:
(a)without the written consent of the Borrowers and each Lender directly affected thereby:
(i)reduce or forgive the principal amount of any Loans or Reimbursement Obligations, or reduce the rate of interest on the Notes or the amount of the Facility Fee or Letter of Credit Fees or diminish or eliminate indemnity or reimbursement rights in favor of such Lender;
(ii)increase the amount of such Lender’s Commitment or extend the expiration date of such Lender’s Commitment;
(iii)postpone or extend the Loan Maturity Date or any other regularly scheduled dates for payments of principal of, or interest on, the Loans or Reimbursement Obligations or any Fees or other amounts payable to such Lender, or extend the termination of any Letters of Credit for which such Lender has a Letter of Credit Participation beyond the Loan Maturity Date;
(iv)(a) amend §14.5.1 or any other provision hereof in a manner that would have the effect of altering the ratable reduction of Commitments or the pro rata sharing of payments otherwise required hereunder, (b) subordinate, or have the effect of subordinating, the Obligations hereunder to any other Indebtedness or other obligation, or (c) release, or have the effect of releasing, all or substantially all of the value of the guarantees of the Obligations;
(b)without the written consent of all of the Lenders, release any of the Significant Subsidiaries from its guaranty obligations under the Guaranty to which it is a party (it being understood that this limitation shall not apply to any release related to transactions permitted by §9.5), release BGI, Barnes Germany, Barnes Luxembourg or Barnes Switzerland from their guaranty obligations under the BGI Guaranty, Barnes Germany Guaranty, Barnes Luxembourg Guaranty or Barnes Switzerland Guaranty, as the case may be, amend or waive this §16.12 or the definition of Required Lenders (it being understood that the addition of one or more additional credit facilities, the allowance of the credit extensions, interest and fees thereunder to share ratably or on a subordinated basis with the Loans, Letters of Credit, interest and Fees in the benefits of the Loan Documents and the inclusion of the holders of such facilities in the determination of Required Lenders shall require only the approval of the Required Lenders);

125

(d)without the written consent of the Administrative Agent, amend or waive §14, the amount or time of payment of the Administrative Agent’s Fee or any Letter of Credit Fees payable for the Administrative Agent’s account or any other provision applicable to the Administrative Agent;
provided, that (i) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by each applicable Issuing Bank in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of such Issuing Bank under this Credit Agreement or any Issuer Document relating to any Letter of Credit issued or to be issued by it; (ii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Swing Line Lender in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of the Swing Line Lender under this Credit Agreement; (iii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent under this Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document.

No course of dealing or delay or omission on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise be prejudicial thereto. No notice to or demand upon the Borrowers shall entitle the Borrowers to other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder (and any amendment, waiver or consent which by its terms requires the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender may be effected with the consent of the applicable Lenders other than Defaulting Lenders), except that (x) the Commitment of any Defaulting Lender may not be increased or extended without the consent of such Lender and (y) any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender that by its terms affects any Defaulting Lender more adversely than other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender.
If a Lender does not consent to a proposed amendment, waiver, consent or release with respect to any Loan Document that requires the consent of such Lender and that has been approved by the Required Lenders, the Borrowers may replace such non-consenting Lender in accordance with § 5.11; provided that such amendment, waiver, consent or release may be effected as a result of the assignment contemplated by such Section (together with all other such assignments required by the Borrowers to be made pursuant to this paragraph).

16.16Judgment Currency. If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other Loan Document in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of each Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the “Judgment Currency”) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Credit Agreement (the “Agreement Currency”), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent from any Borrower in the Agreement Currency, such Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or the Person to whom such obligation was owing against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent in such currency, the Administrative Agent agrees to return the amount of any excess to such Borrower (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable law).
16.17Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial Institutions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Lender that is an Affected Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the write-down and conversion powers of the Applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:
(a)the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the Applicable Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any Lender that is an Affected Financial Institution; and
(b)the effects of any Bail-in Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:
(i)a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;
(ii)a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such Affected Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document; or







DB3/ 204224713.6

128

(iii)the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of the Applicable Resolution Authority.
16.18Acknowledgment Regarding Any Supported QFCs. To the extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for any Hedge Agreement or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, “QFC Credit Support”, and each such QFC, a “Supported QFC”), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the “U.S. Special Resolution Regimes”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States):
(a)In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “Covered Party”) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.
(b)As used in this §16.18, the following terms have the following meanings:
“BHC Act Affiliate” of a party means an “affiliate” (as such term is defined under, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 1841(k)) of such party.
“Covered Entity” means any of the following: (i) a “covered entity” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 252.82(b); (ii) a “covered bank” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 47.3(b); or (iii) a “covered FSI” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 382.2(b).




DB3/ 204224713.6

129

“Default Right” has the meaning assigned to that term in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. §§ 252.81, 47.2 or 382.1, as applicable.
“QFC” has the meaning assigned to the term “qualified financial contract” in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 5390(c)(8)(D).
17.TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS.
17.1Existing Credit Agreement Superseded. This Credit Agreement shall on the Closing Date amend, restate, and supersede the Existing Credit Agreement in its entirety, except as provided in this §17. On the Closing Date, the rights and obligations of the parties evidenced by the Existing Credit Agreement shall be evidenced by this Credit Agreement. All “Obligations” (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) shall continue to be outstanding except as expressly modified by this Credit Agreement and any other applicable Loan Documents and shall be governed in all respects by this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, it being agreed and understood that this Credit Agreement represents a modification of, and does not constitute a novation, satisfaction, payment or reborrowing of any Obligation (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement), nor does it operate as a waiver of any right, power or remedy of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender under any “Loan Documents” (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement).
17.2Return or Cancellation of Notes. Upon receipt by any Lender of its Notes hereunder on the Closing Date, any “Notes” of the Borrowers held by such Lender pursuant to and as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement shall be deemed to be no longer effective.

17.3Fees Under Superseded Agreement. Commencing on the Closing Date and all periods going forward, the Facility Fee shall be payable by the Borrowers to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders in accordance with §2.2.
18.NO ADVISORY OR FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY.
In connection with all aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document), each Borrower and each other Loan Party acknowledges and agrees, and acknowledges its Affiliates’ understanding, that: (i) (A) the arranging and other services regarding this Credit Agreement provided by the Administrative Agent, each Co-Lead Arranger and each Lender, are arm’s-length commercial transactions between the Borrowers, each other Loan Party and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, each Co-Lead Arranger and each Lender, on the other hand, (B) each of the Borrowers and the other Loan Parties has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate, and (C) each Borrower and each other Loan Party is capable of evaluating, and understands and accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents; (ii) (A) the Administrative Agent, each Co-Lead Arranger and each Lender each is and has been acting solely as a principal and, except as expressly agreed in writing by the relevant parties, has not been, is not, and will not be acting as an advisor, agent or fiduciary for the Borrowers, any other Loan Party or any of their respective Affiliates, or any other Person and (B) neither the Administrative Agent, nor each Co-Lead Arranger and Lender has any obligation to the Borrowers, any other Loan Party or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except those

130

obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents; and (iii) the Administrative Agent, each Co-Lead Arranger and each Lender and their respective Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Borrowers, the other Loan Parties and their respective Affiliates, and neither the Administrative Agent nor any Co-Lead Arranger has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to the Borrowers, any other Loan Party or any of their respective Affiliates. To the fullest extent permitted by law, each of the Borrowers and the other Loan Parties hereby waives and releases any claims that it may have against the Administrative Agent, each Co-Lead Arranger and each Lender with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect of any transaction contemplated hereby.
