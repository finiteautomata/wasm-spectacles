E.    NOW, THEREFORE, to induce the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to enter into this Second Amendment and in consideration of the promises and the mutual covenants herein contained, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:
Section 1.Defined Terms. Each capitalized term used herein but not otherwise defined herein has the meaning given such term in the Credit Agreement, as amended by this Second Amendment (unless otherwise indicated). Unless otherwise indicated, all section references in this Second Amendment refer to sections of the Credit Agreement.

2.1Amendments to Section 1.02 – Certain Defined Terms.




(a)The following definitions are hereby amended and restated in their entirety to read as follows:

“Agreement” means this Credit Agreement, including any schedules and exhibits hereto, as amended by the First Amendment and the Second Amendment, and as the same may from time to time be amended, modified, supplemented or restated.
“Applicable Margin” means, for any day, with respect to any ABR Loan or Eurodollar Loan, or with respect to the Commitment Fee Rate, as the case may be, the rate per annum set forth in the Borrowing Base Utilization Grid below based upon the Borrowing Base Utilization Percentage then in effect:
Borrowing Base Utilization Grid
<25%
≥25%, but
<50%
≥50%, but
<75%
≥75%, but
<90%
≥90%
ABR Loans 1.75% 2.00% 2.25% 2.50% 2.75%

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Consolidated Leverage Ratio for the Reference Period ending on the last day of any fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as applicable, commencing on the last day of the fiscal quarter ending following the date on which the Independence Acquisition is consummated, is less than 1.50 to 1.00, then the Applicable Margin set forth in the above grid with respect to ABR Loans and Eurodollar Loans (but, for purposes of clarity, not the Commitment Fee Rate) will, in each case, decrease by 0.25% during the period from and including the first day immediately following the date the financial statements and the related compliance certificate are delivered pursuant to Section 8.01(a) or Section 8.01(b), as applicable, and Section 8.01(c) for such fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as applicable, through and including the date of delivery of the financial statements and the related compliance certificate pursuant to Section 8.01(a) or Section 8.01(b), as applicable, and Section 8.01(c) for the immediately succeeding fiscal quarter.

1



“Applicable Margin” means the rate per annum set forth on the grid when the Borrowing Base Utilization Percentage is at its highest level.
    In the event that the certified calculation of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio previously delivered pursuant to Section 8.01(c) was inaccurate (and such inaccuracy is discovered while any Commitments or Loans are outstanding), and such inaccuracy, if corrected, would have led to the application of a higher Applicable Margin for the Loans for any period (an “Applicable Period”) than the Applicable Margin applied for such Applicable Period, then, to the extent any Commitments or Loans are outstanding at such time, (i) the Borrower shall as soon as practicable deliver to the Administrative Agent the correct certified calculation of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio for such Applicable Period, (ii) the Applicable Margin shall be determined as if the level for such higher Applicable Margin were applicable for such Applicable Period, and (iii) the Borrower shall within ten (10) Business Days of written demand thereof by the Administrative Agent pay to the Administrative Agent the accrued additional interest owing as a result of such increased Applicable Margin for the Loans for such Applicable Period, which payment shall be promptly applied by the Administrative Agent in accordance with this Agreement.

(a)    Second Amendment Borrowing Base. For the period from and including the Second Amendment Effective Date to but excluding the next Redetermination Date, the amount of the Borrowing Base shall be $360,000,000.
