(e)Section 2.02(a) (Borrowing Base) of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended and restated to read as follows:
7


(a) Borrowing Base. The initial Borrowing Base in effect as of Closing Date has been set by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and acknowledged by the Borrower as $128,000,000. Such initial Borrowing Base shall remain in effect until the next redetermination or adjustment made pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation, such automatic reduction set forth in Section 2.02(d)(iii). The Borrowing Base shall be determined in accordance with the standards set forth in Section 2.02(e) and is subject to periodic redetermination pursuant to Sections 2.02(b) and 2.02(c), and mandatory reductions pursuant to Section 2.02(d); provided that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall the Borrowing Base exceed $600,000,000 unless agreed to by all of the Lenders and the Intercreditor Agreement has been, or will substantially contemporaneously will be, amended to increase the First Lien Cap (as such term is defined therein) and to make such other amendments, if any, as the parties to the Intercreditor Agreement shall agree.
(f)Section 2.02(d) (Mandatory Reductions) of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by adding the following new clause (iii) to the end thereof:
(iii) Unless the reduction set forth in this clause (iii) is waived by the Required Lenders, the Borrowing Base shall automatically reduce on July 1, 2020 by an amount equal to $25,000,000. The Borrowing Base, as reduced pursuant to this Section 2.02(d)(iii) shall remain in effect at such applicable amount until the effective date of any subsequent Borrowing Base redetermination or adjustment made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(g)Section 2.02(e) (Standards for Redetermination) of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended and restated to read as follows:
(e) Standards for Redetermination. Each redetermination of the Borrowing Base by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders pursuant to this Section 2.02 shall be made (i) in the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders (but in accordance with the other provisions of this Section 2.02(e)), (ii) in accordance with the Administrative Agent’s and the Lenders’ customary internal standards and practices for valuing and redetermining the value of Oil and Gas Properties in connection with reserve based oil and gas loan transactions, (iii) in conjunction with the most recent Independent Engineering Report or Internal Engineering Report, as applicable, or other information received by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders relating to the Proven Reserves of the Borrower and the Guarantors, and (iv) based upon the estimated value of the Proven Reserves owned by the Borrower and the Guarantors as determined by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. In valuing and redetermining the Borrowing Base, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may also consider the business, financial condition, and Indebtedness obligations of the Borrower and the Guarantors and such other factors as the Administrative Agent and the Lenders customarily deem appropriate, including without limitation, commodity price assumptions, projections of production, operating expenses, general and administrative expenses, capital costs, working capital requirements, liquidity evaluations, dividend payments, environmental costs, and legal costs. In that regard, the Borrower acknowledges that the determination of the Borrowing Base contains a value cushion (market value in excess of loan value), which is essential for the adequate protection of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. Subject to the last sentence of Section 5.08(a), to the extent a Proven Reserve is not encumbered by an Acceptable Security Interest, such Proven Reserve shall not be included or considered for inclusion in the Borrowing Base to the extent an Acceptable Security Interest thereon would be necessary to cause the Administrative Agent to have an Acceptable Security Interest in (x) at least 90% (by value) or, to the extent requested by
8


the Administrative Agent, 95% (by value) of the Proven Reserves and the Oil and Gas Properties relating thereto, (y) 90% (by value) or, to the extent requested by the Administrative Agent, 95% (by value) of the Loan Parties’ other Oil and Gas Properties, and (z) 100% (by value) of the Original Mortgaged Properties (other than such Original Mortgaged Properties which are Disposed of as permitted under Section 6.04(c)). At all times after the Administrative Agent has given the Borrower notification of a redetermination of the Borrowing Base under this Section 2.02, the Borrowing Base shall be equal to the redetermined amount or such lesser amount designated by the Borrower and disclosed in writing to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders until the Borrowing Base is subsequently redetermined in accordance with this Section 2.02; provided that the Borrower shall not request that the Borrowing Base be reduced to a level that would result in a Borrowing Base Deficiency (without giving effect to the proviso in the definition thereof). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (x) to the extent the redetermined Borrowing Base is less than or equal to the Borrowing Base in effect prior to such redetermination, such redetermined Borrowing Base must be approved by the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders, and (y) to the extent the redetermined Borrowing Base is greater than the Borrowing Base in effect prior to such redetermination, such redetermined Borrowing Base must be approved by the Administrative Agent and all of the Lenders.
(h)Section 2.03(c)(iii) (Certain Limitations) of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended and restated to read as follows:
(iii)  subject to clause (vii) below, if the Administrative Agent is unable to determine the Eurodollar Rate for Eurodollar Rate Advances comprising any requested Borrowing, the right of the Borrower to select Eurodollar Rate Advances for such Borrowing or for any subsequent Borrowing shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and each Advance comprising such Borrowing shall be a Reference Rate Advance;
(i)Section 2.03(c)(iv) (Certain Limitations) of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended and restated to read as follows:
(iv) subject to clause (vii) below, if the Majority Lenders shall, at least one Business Day before the date of any requested Borrowing, notify the Administrative Agent that the Eurodollar Rate for Eurodollar Rate Advances comprising such Borrowing will not adequately reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or funding their respective Eurodollar Rate Advances, as the case may be, for such Borrowing, the right of the Borrower to select Eurodollar Rate Advances for such Borrowing or for any subsequent Borrowing shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and each Advance comprising such Borrowing shall be a Reference Rate Advance;
(j)Section 2.03(c)(vii) (Certain Limitations) of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended and restated to read as follows:
(vii) Effect of Benchmark Transition Event.
(A) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement to replace the Eurodollar
9


Base Rate with a Replacement Rate. Any such amendment with respect to a Benchmark Transition Event will become effective at 5:00 p.m. (Houston, Texas time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Administrative Agent has posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrower so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such amendment from Lenders comprising the Majority Lenders. Any such amendment with respect to an Early Opt-in Election will become effective on the date that Lenders comprising the Majority Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Majority Lenders accept such amendment. No replacement of the Eurodollar Base Rate with a Replacement Rate pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(vii) will occur prior to the applicable Benchmark Transition Start Date.
(B) In connection with the implementation of a Replacement Rate, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement.
(C) The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (1) any occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, and its related Benchmark Replacement Date and Benchmark Transition Start Date, (2) the implementation of any Replacement Rate, (3) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes and (4) the commencement or conclusion of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or Lenders pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(vii), including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party hereto, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(vii).
(D) Upon the Borrower’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the Borrower may revoke any request for a Eurodollar Rate Advance of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Advances to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a borrowing of or conversion to a Reference Rate Advance. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period, the component of the Adjusted Reference Rate based upon the Eurodollar Base Rate will not be used in any determination of the Adjusted Reference Rate.
(E) The Replacement Rate shall replace the Eurodollar Base Rate for all purposes under the Loan Documents unless and until (1) an event described in Section 2.03(c)(ii), (iii) or (iv) or a Benchmark Transition Event occurs with respect to the Replacement Rate or (2) the Administrative Agent (or the Majority Lenders through the Administrative Agent) notifies the Borrower that the Replacement Rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding the Advances bearing interest at the Replacement Rate, at which time the right of the Borrower to select Advances bearing interest at the Replacement Rate for any Borrowing shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and each Advance bearing interest at the Replacement Rate shall be Converted to a Reference Rate Advance.
