(w)     Section 9.24 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

(i)    such Lender is not using “plan assets” (within the meaning of Section 3(42) of ERISA or otherwise) of one or more Benefit Plans with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments or this Agreement;


16

(ii)    the transaction exemption set forth in one or more PTEs, such as PTE 84-14 (a class exemption for certain transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers), PTE 95-60 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving insurance company general accounts), PTE 90-1 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTE 91-38 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving bank collective investment funds) or PTE 96-23 (a class exemption for certain transactions determined by in-house asset managers), is applicable with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement;
(iii)    (A) such Lender is an investment fund managed by a “Qualified Professional Asset Manager” (within the meaning of Part VI of PTE 84-14), (B) such Qualified Professional Asset Manager made the investment decision on behalf of such Lender to enter into, participate in, administer and perform the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement, (C) the entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement satisfies the requirements of sub-sections (b) through (g) of Part I of PTE 84- 14 and (D) to the best knowledge of such Lender, the requirements of subsection (a) of Part I of PTE 84-14 are satisfied with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement; or
(iv)    such other representation, warranty and covenant as may be agreed in writing between the Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, and such Lender.
(b)     In addition, unless either (1) sub-clause (i) in the immediately preceding clause (a) is true with respect to a Lender or (2) a Lender has provided another representation, warranty and covenant in accordance with sub-clause (iv) in the immediately preceding clause (a), such Lender further (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party, that the Administrative Agent is not a fiduciary with respect to the assets of such Lender involved in such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement (including in connection with the reservation or exercise of any rights by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, any Loan Document or any documents related hereto or thereto).


17

SECTION 9.27. Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs. To the extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for Hedging Agreements or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, “QFC Credit Support” and each such QFC a “Supported QFC”), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the “U.S. Special Resolution Regimes”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States): in the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “Covered Party”) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.

SECTION 3.     Effect of Amendments. As used in the Amended Credit Agreement, the terms “Agreement”, “this Agreement”, “herein”, “hereinafter”, “hereto”, “hereof” and words of similar import shall, unless the context otherwise requires, from and after the Amendment No. 4 Effective Date, mean or refer to the Amended Credit Agreement. As used in any other Loan Document, from and after the Amendment No. 4 Effective Date, all references to the Credit Agreement in such Loan Documents shall, unless the context otherwise requires, mean or refer to the Amended Credit Agreement.
SECTION 4.     Additional Undertakings. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Amended Credit Agreement, each Borrower covenants and agrees with each Revolving Credit Lender that, on and after the Amendment No. 4 Effective Date, so long as the Amended Credit Agreement remains in effect and until the Revolving Credit Commitments have been terminated, the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure has been reduced to zero and all Fees


18

and other expenses or amounts payable under any Loan Document to or for the benefit of the Administrative Agent or any Revolving Credit Lender, Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank shall have been paid in full (other than contingent indemnification obligations not then due and payable), unless the Required Revolving Credit Lenders shall otherwise consent in writing:
(a)     In the case of Terex, during the Waiver Period, Terex will not permit Available Liquidity to be less than (i) on June 30, 2020 or September 30, 2020, $100,000,000, and (ii) on December 31, 2020, $150,000,000.
(b)     In the case of Terex, during the Waiver Period or the Reinstatement Period, Terex will not declare or pay, directly or indirectly, any dividend or make any other distribution (by reduction of capital or otherwise), whether in cash, property, securities or a combination thereof, with respect to any of its Equity Interests or directly or indirectly redeem, purchase, retire or otherwise acquire for value any of its Equity Interests or set aside any amount for any such purpose, including pursuant to Section 6.06 of the Amended Credit Agreement; provided, however, that (i) during the Waiver Period and the Reinstatement Period, Terex may pay dividends with respect to its Equity Interests solely in additional shares of its Equity Interests, (ii) during the Waiver Period and the Reinstatement Period, Terex may repurchase Equity Interests (x) in accordance with Section 6.04(i) of the Amended Credit Agreement and (y) with the net proceeds of a substantially concurrent issuance of Qualified Equity Interests and (iii) during the Reinstatement Period, if, after giving effect to the payment of such dividend or making of such distribution, the pro forma Available Liquidity of Terex and its Restricted Subsidiaries is not less than $300,000,000, Terex may do any of the foregoing to the extent otherwise permitted by Section 6.06(a) of the Amended Credit Agreement.
(c)     Such Borrower will not, and will not cause or permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to:
(i)    during the Waiver Period or the Reinstatement Period, request Incremental Commitments pursuant to Section 2.27(a)(x) of the Amended Credit Agreement in an aggregate amount that, together with all Incremental Commitments previously established under such Section 2.27(a)(x), would exceed $150,000,000; or
(ii)    (A) during the Waiver Period, borrow any Incremental Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.27 of the Amended Credit Agreement or (B) during the Reinstatement Period, borrow any Incremental Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.27(a)(x) of the Amended Credit Agreement, in each case, unless such Incremental Term Loans are either unsecured or secured by liens junior to the Liens securing the Obligations pursuant to an intercreditor agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(d)     In the case of Terex, during the Waiver Period, Terex will furnish to the Administrative Agent for distribution by the Administrative Agent to each Consenting


19

Revolving Credit Lender (i) within 30 days after the end of each of the first two months of each fiscal quarter, the financial information provided on Exhibit A hereto, all certified by one of its Financial Officers as fairly presenting in all material respects the financial condition and results of operations of Terex and its consolidated Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP consistently applied and (ii) on or prior to the seventh Business Day of each month, a report in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent detailing the Consolidated Cash Balance as of the last Business Day of the immediately preceding month certified by a Financial Officer of Terex.
(e)     In the case of Terex, if on any Business Day during the Waiver Period (i) the sum of the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure and the Aggregate Contract Loan Exposure is greater than $180,000,000 and (ii) the Consolidated Cash Balance exceeds the Consolidated Cash Balance Limit, then Terex shall, within five Business Days, cause the applicable Borrower to prepay outstanding Swingline Loans and Revolving Loans (as determined by Terex) in an aggregate principal amount equal to the lesser of (i) an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess and (ii) the aggregate amount of the then outstanding Swingline Loans and Revolving Loans. Each prepayment pursuant to this Section 4(e) shall be accompanied by accrued and unpaid interest on the amount prepaid to the date of such prepayment, and shall be without premium or penalty but otherwise subject to the requirements of Section 2.16 of the Amended Credit Agreement.
(f)     Such Borrower will not, during the Waiver Period, request any Borrowing of any Swingline Loans, Contract Loans or Revolving Loans if, after giving effect to such Borrowing and the application of the proceeds thereof, (i) the sum of the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure and the Aggregate Contract Loan Exposure would exceed $180,000,000 and (ii) the pro forma Consolidated Cash Balance would exceed the Consolidated Cash Balance Limit. Each Borrowing during the Waiver Period shall be deemed to constitute a representation and warranty by Terex and the applicable Borrower on the date of such Borrowing as to the matters specified in this Section 4(f).  
For the avoidance of doubt, following the earlier of (i) January 1, 2022 and (ii) the delivery of a Covenant Reversion Notice, the provisions of this Section 4 shall cease to apply and the provisions in the Amended Credit Agreement shall govern without regard to this Section 4.
SECTION 5.     Representations and Warranties. To induce the other parties hereto to enter into this Agreement, each Loan Party party hereto hereby represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and each of the Revolving Credit Lenders party hereto that:
(a)     This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by it and constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against each of the Loan Parties party hereto in accordance with its terms except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).


20

(b)     At the time of and immediately after giving effect to this Agreement, the representations and warranties set forth in Article III of the Amended Credit Agreement are true and correct in all material respects (or, in the case of any representations and warranties qualified by materiality, Material Adverse Effect or words of similar import, in all respects) on and as of the date hereof with the same effect as though made on and as of the date hereof, except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case they shall have been true and correct in all material respects (or, in the case of any representations and warranties qualified by materiality, Material Adverse Effect or words of similar import, in all respects) as of such earlier date.
(c)     Each Borrower and each other Loan Party is in compliance in all material respects with all the terms and provisions set forth in each Loan Document on its part to be observed or performed, and at the time of and immediately after giving effect to this Agreement, no Event of Default or Default has occurred and is continuing.
(d)     The information included in any certification regarding beneficial ownership as required by 31 C.F.R. § 1010.230 (the “Beneficial Ownership Regulation”) provided by any Loan Party on or prior to the Amendment No. 4 Effective Date to any Lender in connection with this Agreement, the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document is true and correct in all material respects.

(d)     the Administrative Agent shall have received (i) a certificate as to the good standing of each Borrower and each Subsidiary Guarantor as of a recent date, from the
