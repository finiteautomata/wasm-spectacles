FORM OF OPINION OF COUNSEL
FOR EACH OF CATERPILLAR AND CFSC
September 10, 2018


To the Banks listed on Schedule I hereto
and to Citibank, N.A., as Agent[, Citibank
Europe plc, UK Branch, as Local Currency Agent, and
MUFG Bank, Ltd. (formerly known as
The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd.),
as Japan Local Currency Agent]

Re: [Name of Applicable Borrower]

Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am in-house counsel for [Name of Applicable Borrower], a Delaware corporation (the “Borrower”), and give this opinion pursuant to Section 7.5 of the Omnibus Amendment No. 3 to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (Three-Year Facility), Amendment No. 2 to Local Currency Addendum and Amendment No. 3 to Japan Local Currency Addendum, dated as of September 10, 2018 (the “Amendment”), among the Borrower, [Caterpillar Inc./Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation], Caterpillar International Finance Designated Activity Company, Caterpillar Finance Kabushiki Kaisha, the Existing Banks parties thereto, the New Banks parties thereto, Citibank Europe plc, UK Branch, as Local Currency Agent, MUFG Bank, Ltd. (formerly known as The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd.), as Japan Local Currency Agent, and Citibank, N.A., as Agent for said Banks. Terms defined in the Amended Credit Agreement (as defined below) are used herein as therein defined.
I have examined the Amendment, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (Three-Year Facility) dated as of September 10, 2015 (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified prior to the date hereof, the “Original Credit Agreement”); [the Local Currency Addendum, dated as of September 10, 2015 (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified prior to the date hereof, the “Original Local Currency Addendum”); the Japan Local Currency Addendum, dated as of September 10, 2015 (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified prior to the date hereof, the “Original Japan Local Currency Addendum”);] the documents furnished by the Borrower pursuant to Section 7 of the Amendment; the [[Restated] Certificate of Incorporation] of the Borrower and any amendments thereto, as currently in effect (the “Charter”); and the [bylaws] of the Borrower and any amendments thereto, as currently in effect (the “Bylaws”). In addition, I have examined the originals, or copies certified to my satisfaction, of such other corporate records of the Borrower, certificates of public officials, and agreements, instruments and other documents, and have conducted such other investigations of fact and law, as I have deemed necessary or advisable for purposes of this opinion letter.
The Original Credit Agreement, as amended by the Amendment, is referred to herein as the “Amended Credit Agreement”. The Original Local Currency Addendum, as amended by the Amendment, is referred to herein as the “Amended Local Currency Addendum”. The Original Japan Local Currency Addendum, as amended by the Amendment, is referred to herein as the “Amended Japan Local Currency Addendum”.
In rendering my opinion, I have assumed the due authorization, execution and delivery of each document referred to herein by all parties to such document other than the Borrower.
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the comments and qualifications set forth below, it is my opinion that:
1.    The Borrower is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each of the jurisdictions listed in Schedule II to this opinion letter.
2.    The execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Amendment and performance by the Borrower of the Amendment [,][and] the Amended Credit Agreement [, the Amended Local Currency Addendum and the Amended Japan Local Currency Addendum] are within the Borrower’s corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not contravene, or constitute a default under (i) the Charter or the Bylaws or (ii) in any material respect, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or any United States Federal or [New York State][Tennessee] law, rule or regulation applicable to the Borrower (I express no opinion relating to the United States federal securities laws or any state securities or Blue Sky laws), (iii) any agreement filed as an exhibit to the Borrower’s annual report on Form 10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) on February 15, 2018, or any agreement filed or incorporated by reference as an exhibit to a filing of the Borrower under Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with the Commission from February 15, 2018 up to and including the date hereof, or (iv) any material judgment, injunction order or decree binding upon the Borrower.
3.    No authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body of the United States[,][or] the State of Delaware [or the State of New York] that in my experience would normally be applicable to general business entities is required for the execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Amendment and performance by the Borrower of the Amendment [,][and] the Amended Credit Agreement [, the Amended Local Currency Addendum and the Amended Japan Local Currency Addendum] (but I express no opinion relating to any state securities or Blue Sky laws).
4.    The Amendment has been duly executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer of the Borrower. Assuming that the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, and each Bank party to the Amendment have duly executed and delivered the Amendment and that each such Bank has notified the Agent that such Bank has executed the Amendment, each of the Amendment [,][and] the Amended Credit Agreement [, the Amended Local Currency Addendum and the Amended Japan Local Currency Addendum], is the valid and binding obligation of the Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms.
5.    There is no pending or, to my actual knowledge, threatened action or proceeding affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator, which purports to affect the legality, validity or enforceability of the Amendment [,][or] the Amended Credit Agreement [, the Amended Local Currency Addendum or the Amended Japan Local Currency Addendum,] or which is reasonably likely to materially adversely affect (i) the financial condition or operations of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) the ability of the Borrower to perform its obligations under the Amendment [,][or] the Amended Credit Agreement [, the Amended Local Currency Addendum and the Amended Japan Local Currency Addendum].
Insofar as the foregoing opinions relate to the valid existence and good standing of the Borrower, they are based solely on the certificates from public officials attached hereto as Exhibit A. Insofar as the foregoing opinions relate to the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any agreement or obligation of the Borrower, such opinions are subject to (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and to general principles of equity and (ii) limitations under applicable law or public policy on waivers of rights or defenses.
I express no opinion as to (i) Sections 2.13 and 8.05 of the Amended Credit Agreement[, or any comparable provisions of the Amended Japan Local Currency Addendum or the Amended Local Currency Addendum], insofar as they provide that any Bank purchasing a participation from another Bank pursuant thereto may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such participation or that any Affiliate of a Bank may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such Bank’s claims under the Amended Credit Agreement[, the Amended Japan Local Currency Addendum or the Amended Local Currency Addendum]; (ii) Section 2.12(c), 7.09 or 8.04(c) of the Amended Credit Agreement[, or any comparable provisions of the Amended Japan Local Currency Addendum or the Amended Local Currency Addendum], to the extent that any such section may be construed as requiring indemnification with respect to a claim, damage, liability or expense incurred as a result of any violation of law by a Bank[,][or] the Agent [the Local Currency Agent or the Japan Local Currency Agent]; (iii) Section 8.08(c) of the Amended Credit Agreement [or any comparable provisions of the Amended Japan Local Currency Addendum or the Amended Local Currency Addendum], insofar as [any] such provision relates to the subject matter jurisdiction of the United States District Court to adjudicate any controversy related to the Amended Credit Agreement; (iv) Sections 8.10 or 8.12, [or ]the last sentence of Section 8.08(b) of the Amended Credit Agreement [or any comparable provisions of the Amended Japan Local Currency Addendum or the Amended Local Currency Addendum] or (v) clauses (B) and (C) of Section 8.08(c) of the Amended Credit Agreement, insofar as either such clause relates to the submission to jurisdiction in any Illinois State or United States federal court sitting in Chicago, Illinois (and any appellate court hearing appeals from any such court) or any United States federal court sitting in Nashville, Tennessee (and any appellate court hearing appeals from any such court), as applicable.
For the purposes of my opinion above as it pertains to the enforceability of the provisions contained in Section 8.08 of the Amended Credit Agreement (and any similar provisions contained in the Amended Local Currency Addendum or the Amended Japan Local Currency Addendum) pursuant to which the parties thereto agree that the laws of the State of New York shall govern such documents, I have assumed that the parties did not enter into any of the agreements described herein with knowledge or deliberate ignorance of the illegality of such document in its place of performance.
[For Cat Financial:][I am qualified to practice law in the State of Tennessee and do not purport to be an expert on, or to express any opinion concerning, any laws other than the law of the State of Tennessee, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal law of the United States. Insofar as the opinions expressed in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 above relate to matters which are governed by the laws of the State of New York, I have assumed for purposes of rendering such opinions that the applicable laws of the State of New York are substantially identical to the laws of the State of Tennessee.]
[For Caterpillar Inc.:] [In rendering the opinion in numbered paragraph 2, I have assumed that to the extent any document referred to in clause (iii) of numbered paragraph 2 is governed by the law of a jurisdiction other than those referred to in the following paragraph, such document would be interpreted in accordance with its plain meaning.]
[The foregoing opinions are limited to the federal law of the United States of America, the law of the State of [New York][Tennessee] and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.]
This opinion letter is limited to the matters expressly set forth herein, and no opinion is implied or may be inferred beyond the matters expressly set forth herein. The opinions expressed herein are being delivered to you as of the date hereof in connection with the transactions described hereinabove and are solely for your benefit in connection with the transactions described hereinabove and may not be relied on, used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to in any manner or for any purpose by any other Person, nor any copies published, communicated or otherwise made available in whole or in part to any other Person without my specific prior written consent, except that (A) you may furnish copies hereof, (i) to your independent auditors and attorneys, (ii) upon the request of any state or federal authority or official having regulatory jurisdiction over you, (iii) pursuant to order or legal process of any court or governmental agency and (iv) to any of your permitted or prospective assigns and/or participants in respect of the Amended Credit Agreement, the Amended Japan Local Currency Addendum and the Amended Local Currency Addendum and (B) assignees that become Banks party to the Amended Credit Agreement pursuant to Section 8.07 thereof may rely on this opinion as if addressed to them on the date hereof, on the condition and understanding that (i) this opinion letter speaks only as of the date hereof as described below and (ii) any such reliance by a future assignee must be actual and reasonable under the circumstances existing at the time such person becomes an assignee, including any changes in law, facts or any other developments known to or reasonably knowable by such person at such time. I assume no obligation to advise you or any other person, or to make any investigations, as to any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof that might affect the opinions expressed herein.
Very truly yours,
