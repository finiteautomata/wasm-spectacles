Except as the context otherwise requires, references to the “Borrower and its subsidiaries” will include the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries after giving effect to the Acquisition.
1.Commitments; Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Commitment Letter, in the fee letter dated the date hereof from the Commitment Parties to you (the “Fee Letter”) and in each of the other fee letters dated the date hereof from one or more of the Commitment Parties to you (collectively with the Fee Letter, the “Fee Letters”), (a) Wells Fargo Bank, JPMorgan and GS are pleased to advise you of their respective commitments to provide to the Parent Borrower 100% of the principal amount of (i) the Incremental Term Loan A or (ii) the New Senior Credit Facilities, as applicable (the “Bank Commitment”) and (b) Wells Fargo Bank, JPMorgan and GS are pleased to advise you of their respective commitments to provide to the Parent Borrower 100% of the principal amount of the Bridge Facility (the “Bridge Commitment” and, together with the Bank Commitment, the “Commitments”).

[[NYCORP:3882362v30:12/20/2018--09:36 AM]]


individually, an “Initial Bridge Lender.” Each of the Bank Commitment and the Bridge Commitment will be allocated among the Initial Bank Lenders and the Initial Bridge Lenders, respectively, on the following basis: 60% to Wells Fargo Bank; 20% to JPMorgan; and 20% to GS. The commitments hereunder of each Initial Lender shall be several and not joint and, in the case of the New Senior Credit Facilities, will be allocated ratably between the Revolving Credit Facility, the New Term Loan A-1 Facility and the New Term Loan A-2 Facility.
In addition to the foregoing, the Commitment Parties will use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the requisite consents for the Amendments. It is understood and agreed that, except as expressly provided herein, this Commitment Letter shall not be construed to impose any obligation upon the Commitment Parties or any of their respective affiliates to ensure that the Best Efforts Amendments will become effective.
2.    Titles and Roles. Each of Wells Fargo Securities, JPMorgan and GS, acting alone or through or with affiliates selected by it, will act as a joint bookrunner and a joint lead arranger (each in such capacities, a “Lead Arranger” and, collectively, the “Lead Arrangers”) in arranging and syndicating the Facilities and the Amendments; provided, however, that Wells Fargo Securities will have the “left” and “highest” placement in any and all marketing materials or other documentation used in connection with the Facilities and the Amendments and shall hold the leading role and responsibilities conventionally associated with such placement, including maintaining sole physical books for the Facilities and the Amendments. JPMorgan will continue to act as the sole administrative agent under the Existing Credit Agreement (as amended by the Amendments) or, if the Backstopped Amendments are not obtained on or prior to the Closing Date, will act as the sole administrative agent for the Senior Credit Facilities (in each case, in such capacity, the “Bank Administrative Agent”), and Wells Fargo Bank will act as the sole administrative agent (in such capacity, the “Bridge Administrative Agent” and, together with the Bank Administrative Agent, the “Administrative Agents”) for the Bridge Facility.

3.    Conditions to Commitment. The Commitments and undertakings of the Commitment Parties hereunder are subject solely to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in the Conditions Annex; it being understood that there are no conditions (implied or otherwise) including compliance with the terms of this Commitment Letter, the Fee Letters and the Financing Documentation, to the commitment hereunder,



[[NYCORP:3882362v30:12/20/2018--09:36 AM]]


or to the availability and initial funding of the Facilities, other than those conditions that are expressly stated in the Conditions Annex to be conditions to the initial funding of the Facilities on the Closing Date (and upon satisfaction or waiver by the Lead Arrangers of such conditions, the initial funding under the Facilities shall occur).
Notwithstanding anything in this Commitment Letter, the Fee Letters or the Financing Documentation (as defined in the Conditions Annex) or any other letter agreement or other undertaking concerning the Facilities or the financing of the Transactions to the contrary, (a) the only representations relating to the Acquired Company, the Parent Borrower and their respective subsidiaries and their respective businesses the accuracy of which shall be a condition to the availability of the Facilities and, if applicable, the Existing Credit Agreement Acquisition Draw on the Closing Date shall be (i) such of the representations made by the Acquired Company in the Acquisition Agreement as are material to the interests of the Initial Lenders in their capacities as such (the “Specified Acquisition Agreement Representations”), but only to the extent that you or your affiliates have the right to terminate your or their respective obligations under the Acquisition Agreement or otherwise decline to close the Acquisition as a result of a breach of any such Specified Acquisition Agreement Representations or any such Specified Acquisition Agreement Representations not being accurate (in each case, determined without regard to any notice requirement) and (ii) the Specified Representations (as defined below) and (b) the terms of the Financing Documentation shall be in a form such that they do not impair the availability of the Facilities on the Closing Date if the conditions set forth in or referred to in this Commitment Letter are satisfied (it being understood that, to the extent any security interest in any Collateral (as defined in the Bank Term Sheet) (other than security interests that may be perfected by (x) the filing of a financing statement under the Uniform Commercial Code and (y) the delivery of certificates evidencing the equity security of each domestic subsidiary of the Parent Borrower (but, with respect to the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries, only to the extent received from the Acquired Company after use of commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such certificates) required to be pledged pursuant to the Bank Term Sheet), is not or cannot be perfected on the Closing Date, then the perfection of such security interests shall not constitute a condition precedent to the availability of the Facilities and, if applicable, the Existing Credit Agreement Acquisition Draw on the Closing Date, but instead, shall be required to be perfected after the Closing Date pursuant to arrangements and timing to be mutually agreed by the Bank Administrative Agent and the Parent Borrower acting reasonably (but not to exceed 60 days after the Closing Date, unless extended by the Bank Administrative Agent). For purposes hereof, “Specified Representations” means the representations and warranties of the Borrower and Guarantors set forth in Financing Documentation relating to corporate status of the Borrower and each Guarantor; corporate power and authority (as to execution, delivery and performance of the applicable Financing Documentation) of the Borrower and the Guarantors; no violation of the Loan Parties’ organizational documents (limited to execution, delivery and performance of the Financing Documentation, incurrence of indebtedness thereunder and the granting of the guarantees and security interests in respect thereof); solvency as of the Closing Date (after giving effect to the Transactions) of the Parent Borrower and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis (as determined pursuant to Annex D hereto); use of proceeds and Federal margin regulations; the Investment Company Act; the PATRIOT Act; the use of proceeds of the Facilities on the Closing Date not violating anti-corruption laws and sanctions; and creation, validity and, subject to the parenthetical in the immediately preceding sentence, perfection of security interests in the Collateral.

other entities committing to the Senior Credit Facilities, including the Initial Bank Lenders, the “Bank Lenders”; such financial institutions and other entities committing to the Bridge Facility, including the Initial Bridge Lenders, the “Bridge Lenders”; and, together with the Bank Lenders, the “Lenders”) upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Commitment Letter. Until the earlier of (i) the date that a Successful Syndication (as defined in the Fee Letter) is achieved and (ii) the date that is 60 days following the Closing Date (the “Syndication Date”), you agree to, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause appropriate members of management of the Acquired Company to, assist us actively in achieving a syndication of the Facilities that is satisfactory to us and you.

(“S&P”), (B) a current public corporate family rating of the Parent Borrower from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and (C) a current public rating with respect to each of the Facilities and the Notes from each of S&P and Moody’s, in each case, prior to the commencement of the Compliance Period (as defined in Annex C hereto) and to participate actively in the process of securing such ratings, including having your senior management meet with such rating agencies and (vii) your ensuring (and, to the extent consistent with the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, using your commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Acquired Company to ensure) that prior to the later of the Closing Date and the Syndication Date there will be no competing issues, offerings, placements, arrangements or syndications of debt securities or commercial bank or other credit facilities by or on behalf of you or your subsidiaries or the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries, being offered, placed or arranged (other than the Facilities and the Notes) without the written consent of the Lead Arranger, unless such issuance, offering, placement, arrangement or syndication could not reasonably be expected, in the reasonable discretion of the Lead Arrangers, to materially impair the syndication of the Facilities or the arrangement of the Amendments (it being understood that indebtedness incurred in the ordinary course of business of the Parent Borrower, the Acquired Company and their respective subsidiaries for capital expenditures and working capital purposes will not materially impair the syndication of the Facilities or the arrangement of the Amendments).
(b)    The Lead Arrangers and/or one or more of their respective affiliates will exclusively manage all aspects of the syndication of the Facilities and the arrangement of the Amendments (in consultation with you and consistent with the terms of this Commitment Letter), including decisions as to the selection and number of prospective Lenders to be approached, when they will be approached, whose commitments will be accepted, any titles offered to the Lenders and the final allocations of the commitments and any related fees among the Lenders, and the Lead Arrangers will exclusively perform all functions and exercise

Notwithstanding the Lead Arrangers’ rights to syndicate the Facilities and receive commitments with respect thereto, (i) the Initial Lenders shall not be relieved or released from their respective obligations hereunder (including their respective obligations to fund the Facilities on the Closing Date) in connection with any syndication, assignment or participation in the Facilities, including their respective Commitments, until the initial funding under the Facilities has occurred on the Closing Date has occurred, (ii) no assignment by any Initial Lender shall become effective with respect to all or any portion of such Initial Lender’s Commitments until the initial funding of the Facilities (except to the extent that Notes are issued and paid for in lieu of the Bridge Facility or a portion thereof), (iii) unless you and we agree in writing, each Initial Lender will retain exclusive control over all rights and obligations with respect to its Commitments in respect of the Facilities, including all rights with respect to consents, modifications, supplements, waivers and amendments, until the Closing Date has occurred and (iv) the Lead Arrangers will not syndicate to (A) those banks, financial institutions and other institutional lenders separately identified (by legal entity name) in writing by you to us on or prior to the date hereof, (B) any other Person (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) determined by the Parent Borrower to be competitors of the Parent Borrower, the Acquired Company or any of their respective subsidiaries and which are specifically identified by the Parent Borrower by written notice to the Bank Administrative Agent or the Bridge Administrative Agent, as applicable, or (C) in the case of the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), any of such Person’s Affiliates (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) to the extent that such Affiliates are reasonably identifiable as Affiliates based solely on the similarity of such Affiliates’ names and are not bona fide debt investment funds (collectively, the “Disqualified Institutions”).
(c)    You shall deliver to the Lead Arrangers, (i) with respect to the Parent Borrower and its subsidiaries, (A) audited consolidated balance sheets and related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholder’s equity and cash flows for the three most recently completed fiscal years ended at least 90 days prior to the Closing Date and (B) unaudited consolidated balance sheets and related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholder’s equity and cash flows for each interim fiscal quarter ended since the last audited financial statements and at least 45 days prior to the Closing Date and for each comparable period in the preceding fiscal year. You shall also deliver to the Lead Arrangers a pro forma consolidated balance sheet and related pro forma consolidated statements of income and cash flows of the Parent Borrower for the twelve-month period ending on the last day of the most recent fiscal quarter ending at least 45 days before the Closing Date (or 90 days before such date if such fiscal quarter is the last fiscal quarter in the Parent Borrower’s fiscal year), prepared after giving pro forma effect to each element of the Transactions as if the Transactions had occurred on the last day of such four quarter period (in the case of such balance sheet) or at the beginning of such period (in the case of such other financial statements).
(d)    You will engage one or more investment banks satisfactory to the Lead Arrangers (collectively, the “Investment Bank”) to publicly sell or privately place the Notes and you will provide to the Investment Bank and the Lead Arrangers, during the entirety of the Compliance Period (as defined in Annex C hereto), a preliminary offering memorandum or preliminary private placement memorandum (collectively, an “Offering Document”) suitable for use in a customary high-yield road show relating to the issuance of the Notes, which contains all audited and unaudited historical and pro forma financial statements and other data to be included therein (including other financial data of the type and form customarily included in offering memoranda for a Rule 144A offering) (which financial statements and other data, for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall require financial information otherwise required by Rule 3-05 (other than the financial statements of the Acquired Company), Rule 3-09, Rule 3-10 (other than customary guarantor and non-guarantor information with respect to sales, EBITDA, liabilities and/or assets, but not of the Acquired Company) and Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X or “segment reporting” for the Acquired Company or any

SCHEDULE I TO ANNEX A
INTEREST AND FEES ON
SENIOR CREDIT FACILITIES

Interest:
At the relevant Borrower’s option, loans (other than Swingline Loans and loans denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars) will bear interest based on the Base Rate or LIBOR, as described below:
A. Base Rate Option
Interest will be at the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate (as defined below). The “Base Rate” is defined as the highest of (a) the NYFRB Rate (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement), plus 1/2 of 1%, (b) the U.S. prime commercial lending rate published by The Wall Street Journal as the “prime rate” and (c) the daily LIBOR (as defined below) for a one month Interest Period (as defined below) plus 1%. Interest shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the last business day of each January, April, July and October and on the Maturity Date and shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 365/366 days. Any loan bearing interest at the Base Rate is referred to herein as a “Base Rate Loan”.
Base Rate Loans will be made on same business day notice and will be in minimum amounts substantially the same as set forth in the Existing Credit Agreement.
B. LIBOR Option
Interest will be determined for periods (“Interest Periods”) of one, two, three or six months (or such other period that is twelve months or less requested by the Parent Borrower and consented to by all relevant Lenders) as selected by the Parent Borrower and will be at an annual rate for Eurocurrency deposits for the corresponding deposits of the relevant currency administered by ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (or any applicable successor quoting service) (“LIBOR”) plus the Applicable Rate. LIBOR will be determined by the Bank Administrative Agent at the start of each Interest Period and, other than in the case of LIBOR used in determining the Base Rate, will be fixed through such period. Interest will be paid on the last day of each Interest Period or, in the case of Interest Periods longer than three months, every three months, and will be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days. LIBOR will be adjusted for maximum statutory reserve requirements (if any) and in no event shall be less than 0%. Any loan bearing interest at LIBOR (other than a Base Rate Loan for which interest is determined by reference to LIBOR) is referred to herein as a “LIBOR Rate Loan”.
LIBOR Rate Loans will be made on three business days’ prior notice (or such longer period as provided in the Existing Credit Agreement) and, in each case, will be in minimum amounts substantially the same as set forth in the Existing Credit Agreement.
Swingline Loans will bear interest at a rate to be mutually agreed between the Parent Borrower and the Swing Line Lender.
Loans denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars will bear interest at LIBOR plus the Applicable Rate.
The Senior Credit Documentation will contain provisions to be mutually agreed with respect to a replacement LIBOR Rate.
Default Interest:
To be substantially as set forth in the Existing Credit Agreement.
Interest Margins:
The applicable interest margins (the “Applicable Rate”) will be:
(a) in the case of the Revolving Credit Facility, 1.400% for LIBOR Rate Loans and 0.400% for Base Rate Loans; and
(b) in the case of the Term Loan Facilities, 1.750% for LIBOR Rate Loans and 0.750% for Base Rate Loans;
provided that after the date on which the Parent Borrower will have delivered financial statements and a compliance certificate for the first full fiscal quarter after the Closing Date, the Applicable Rate with respect to the Senior Credit Facilities will be determined in accordance with the Pricing Grid set forth below.
For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the Best Efforts Amendments described under this heading are not obtained, the applicable interest rate margins for the Senior Credit Facilities (including, without limitation, the Incremental Term Loan A Facility and the New Senior Credit Facilities) will be the interest rate margins set forth in the Existing Credit Agreement.
Facility Fee:
A facility fee (the “Facility Fee”) will accrue on the full amount of the Revolving Credit Facility, regardless of usage, with exclusions for Defaulting Lenders. Such Facility Fee will initially be 0.350% per annum and after delivery of financial statements for the first full fiscal quarter ending after the Closing Date will be determined in accordance with the Pricing Grid set forth below. All accrued Facility Fees will be fully earned and due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last business day of each January, April, July and October (calculated on a 360-day basis) for the account of the Lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and will accrue from the Closing Date.
Letter of Credit Fees:
The Parent Borrower will pay to the Bank Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, letter of credit participation fees equal to the Applicable Rate for LIBOR Rate Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility, in each case, on the undrawn amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit. The Parent Borrower will pay to each L/C issuer with respect to Letters of Credit a fronting fee to be agreed upon by the Parent Borrower and such L/C issuer.
Other Fees:
The Lead Arrangers and the Bank Administrative Agent will receive such other fees as will have been agreed in a fee letter among them and the Parent Borrower.
Pricing Grid:
The Applicable Rate and the Facility Fee shall be based on the Leverage Ratio pursuant to the following grid:

Borrower:
Grief, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Parent Borrower”).
Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners:

Bridge Administrative Agent:
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (in such capacity, the “Bridge Administrative Agent”).
Bridge Loans:
Unsecured senior credit facility (the “Bridge Facility”) consisting of bridge loans (the “Bridge Loans”) in an aggregate principal amount of up to $700.0 million, minus the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, if any, issued on or prior to the Closing Date (including pursuant to an escrow arrangement).
Use of Proceeds:
The proceeds of the Bridge Loans will be used, together with the Senior Credit Facilities and the proceeds of the Notes, if any, issued on or prior to the Closing Date (including pursuant to an escrow arrangement), solely to finance (a) the Acquisition, (b) the Refinancing and (c) the payment of fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions.
Availability:
The Bridge Facility will be available only in a single draw of the full amount of the Bridge Facility on the Closing Date. Amounts borrowed under the Bridge Facility that are repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.
Documentation:
The documentation for the Bridge Loans will include, among other items, a bridge loan agreement, guarantees and other appropriate documents, including an exhibit with the form of the indenture in connection with the issuance of any Exchange Notes (as defined below) as contemplated below (collectively, the “Bridge Loan Documentation”), all on terms consistent with this Bridge Term Sheet. The Bridge Loan Documentation will contain such other terms as are usual and customary for bridge loan agreements for comparably rated companies in a similar industry, consistent with the operational requirements of the Parent Borrower and its subsidiaries in light of their size, cash flow, industry business, business practices and operations and with such modifications to reflect the Transaction and market conditions as of the Closing Date. The Bridge Loan Documentation will contain customary high yield covenants, events of default and financial definitions, with basket sizes, exceptions and other modifications as shall be determined by the Lead Arrangers in light of prevailing market conditions on the Closing Date but, except as otherwise set forth herein, in no event shall any of the foregoing be inconsistent with or more restrictive than as set forth in the Existing Credit Agreement. The provisions of this paragraph are referred to as the “Bridge Documentation Principles.”
Ranking:
The Bridge Loans and the Guarantees thereof will be unsecured senior debt of the Parent Borrower and the Guarantors, pari passu with all other unsecured senior debt of the Parent Borrower and the Guarantors.
Guarantors:
Same guarantors as the guarantors for the Senior Credit Facilities (each a “Guarantor”; and its guarantee is referred to herein as a “Guarantee”). The Parent Borrower and the Guarantors are herein referred to collectively as the “Credit Parties” and each a “Credit Party.”
Security:
None.
Interest:
Interest rates and fees in connection with the Bridge Loans and the Exchange Notes will be as specified in the Fee Letter and on Schedule I attached hereto.
Maturity/Exchange:
The Bridge Loans will mature on the date (the “Initial Maturity Date”) that is twelve months after the Closing Date. If any Bridge Loan has not been repaid in full on or prior to the Initial Maturity Date, subject to payment of the Bridge Rollover Fee (as defined in the Fee Letter) and unless (i) the Borrower or any of its subsidiaries is subject to a bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding or (ii) there exists a default in the payment when due at final maturity of any indebtedness (of an amount consistent with the terms of the Senior Loan Documentation) of the Borrower or any of its subsidiaries, or the maturity of such indebtedness shall have been accelerated, the Bridge Loans will automatically be converted into term loans (each, an “Extended Term Loan”) due on the date that is 8 years after the Closing Date. The Extended Term Loans will be governed by the provisions of the Bridge Loan Documentation and will have the same terms as the Bridge Loans except as expressly set forth on Schedule II hereto.
Lenders under the Extended Term Loans will have the option at any time or from time to time to receive exchange notes under an indenture (the “Exchange Notes”) in exchange for such Extended Term Loans having the terms set forth on Schedule III hereto; provided that the Parent Borrower may defer the issuance of Exchange Notes until such time as the Parent Borrower has received requests to issue an aggregate principal amount of Exchange Notes equal to at least $100 million.
Mandatory Prepayment:
The Parent Borrower will be required to prepay the Bridge Loans on a pro rata basis, at par plus accrued and unpaid interest with:
(a)    100% of the net cash proceeds from the issuance of the Notes and/or any other indebtedness (other than the Senior Credit Facilities) by the Parent Borrower or any of its subsidiaries, subject to exceptions to be mutually agreed upon in accordance with the Bridge Documentation Principles;
(b)    100% of the net cash proceeds from any issuance of equity securities of, or from any capital contribution to, the Parent Borrower or any of its subsidiaries in excess of amounts required to be paid to the Lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities, subject to exceptions to be mutually agreed upon in accordance with the Bridge Documentation Principles; and
(c)    100% of the net cash proceeds of all non-ordinary course asset sales, insurance proceeds and condemnation recoveries and other asset dispositions by the Parent Borrower or any of its subsidiaries in excess of amounts either reinvested in accordance with the Senior Credit Facilities or required to be paid to the Lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities, subject to exceptions to be mutually agreed upon in accordance with the Bridge Documentation Principles.
Each such prepayment will be made together with accrued interest to the date of prepayment, but without premium or penalty (except breakage costs related to prepayments not made on the last day of the relevant interest period).
In the event any Bridge Lender or affiliate of a Bridge Lender purchases Securities (as defined in the Fee Letter) from the Parent Borrower pursuant to the securities demand provisions in the Fee Letter, the net cash proceeds received by the Parent Borrower in respect of such Securities may, at the option of such Bridge Lender or affiliate, be applied first to prepay the Bridge Loans of such Bridge Lender or affiliate rather than pro rata (provided that if there is more than one such Bridge Lender or affiliate then such net cash proceeds will be applied pro rata to prepay the Bridge Loans of all such Bridge Lenders or affiliates in proportion to such Bridge Lenders’ or affiliates’ principal amount of Securities purchased from the Borrower) prior to being applied to prepay the Bridge Loans held by other Bridge Lenders.
In addition, notwithstanding anything in the Commitment Letter (or any Annex thereto) to the contrary (but subject to the applicable terms of the Senior Credit Documentation), the net cash proceeds of the issuance or incurrence of debt by the Parent Borrower or any of its subsidiaries shall be applied to prepay the Bridge Facility prior to any prepayment under the Senior Credit Facilities.
