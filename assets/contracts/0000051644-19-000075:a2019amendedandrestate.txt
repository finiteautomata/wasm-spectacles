ARTICLE II
AMOUNTS AND TERMS OF THE ADVANCES AND LETTERS OF CREDIT
SECTION 2.01. The Advances and Letters of Credit. (a) Advances. Each Lender severally agrees, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, to make Advances to any Borrower from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Restatement Date until the Termination Date applicable to such Lender in an aggregate amount (based in respect of any Advances to be denominated in a Committed Currency or the Equivalent in Dollars determined on the date of delivery of the applicable Notice of Borrowing) for all Borrowers not to exceed such Lender’s Unused Commitment. Each Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof in the case of Advances denominated in Dollars and the Equivalent of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof in the case of Advances denominated in any Committed Currency (determined on the date of the applicable Notice of Borrowing) and shall consist of Advances of the same Type and in the same currency made on the same day by the Lenders ratably according to their respective Revolving Credit Commitments. Within the limits of each Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment, any Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.01(a), prepay pursuant to Section 2.10 and reborrow under this Section 2.01(a).
(b)    Letters of Credit. Each Issuing Bank agrees, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, to issue letters of credit (each, a “Letter of Credit”) for the account of any Borrower from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Restatement Date until 30 days before the latest Termination Date (i) in an aggregate Available Amount for all Letters of Credit issued by all Issuing Banks not to exceed at any time the Letter of Credit Facility at such time, (ii) in an amount for each Issuing Bank (converting all non-Dollar amounts into the then Dollar Equivalent thereof) not to exceed the amount of such Issuing Banks’ Letter of Credit Commitment at such time and (iii) in an amount for each such Letter of Credit (converting all non-Dollar amounts into the then Dollar Equivalent thereof) not to exceed an amount equal to the Unused Commitments of the Lenders having a Termination Date no earlier than the expiration date of such Letter of Credit at such time. Each Letter of Credit shall be in an amount of $10,000 (or the Equivalent thereof in any Committed L/C Currency) or any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. No Letter of Credit shall have an expiration date (including all rights of any Borrower or the beneficiary to require renewal) later than the earlier of (x) 15 days prior to the latest Termination Date or (y) the date that is one year after the issuance thereof; provided that any Letter of Credit which provides for automatic one-year extension(s) of such expiration date shall be deemed to comply with the foregoing requirement if the applicable Issuing Bank has the unconditional right to prevent any such automatic extension from taking place. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding sentence, Letters of Credit issued by any Issuing Bank may have expiration dates as mutually agreed upon by the Company and such Issuing Bank (any such Letters of Credit with expiration dates after 15 days prior to the latest Termination Date, “Special Letters of Credit”). Within the limits referred to above, any Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of Credit under this Section 2.01(b), repay any Advances resulting from drawings thereunder pursuant to Section 2.03(c) and request the issuance of additional Letters of Credit under this Section 2.01(b). Each letter of credit listed on Schedule 2.01(b) shall be deemed to constitute a Letter of Credit issued hereunder, and each Lender that is an issuer of such a Letter of Credit shall, for purposes of Section 2.03, be deemed to be an Issuing Bank for each such letter of credit, provided that all such letters of credit shall be permitted to expire on their respective expiration dates as in effect on the date of this Agreement (and the respective Issuing Banks are permitted to take such steps under such letters of credit which have automatic renewal or extension provisions to prevent such automatic renewals or extensions from occurring) and any replacement of any such letter of credit shall be issued by an Issuing Bank pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The terms “issue”, “issued”, “issuance” and all similar terms, when applied to a Letter of Credit, shall include any renewal, extension or amendment thereof. Any Issuing Bank may, in its discretion, arrange for one or more Letters of Credit to be issued by Affiliates of such Issuing Bank, in which case the term “Issuing Bank” shall include any such Affiliate with respect to Letters of Credit issued by such Affiliate; provided that the original Issuing Bank shall continue as the “Issuing Bank” and shall remain liable in all respects for the performance of such Affiliate with respect to any such Letter of Credit.
SECTION 2.02. Making the Advances. (a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.03(a) and except with respect to Advances made pursuant to Section 2.03(c), each Borrowing shall be made on notice, given not later than (x) 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Borrowing in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Eurocurrency Rate Advances denominated in Dollars or any Committed

Currency (other than Swiss Francs), (y) 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the fourth Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Borrowing in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Eurocurrency Rate Advances denominated in Swiss Francs, or (z) 2:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date of the proposed Borrowing in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Base Rate Advances, by any Borrower to the Agent, which shall give to each Lender prompt notice thereof in writing. Each such notice of a Borrowing (a “Notice of Borrowing”) shall be in writing in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto, specifying therein the requested (i) date of such Borrowing, (ii) Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing, (iii) aggregate amount of such Borrowing, and (iv) in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, initial Interest Period and currency for each such Advance; provided, however, that if any such notice shall fail to specify a currency, Dollars shall be deemed to have been specified. Each Lender shall, before 4:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date of each Borrowing denominated in Dollars and before 9:30 A.M (New York City time) on the date of each Borrowing denominated in a Committed Currency, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent at the applicable Agent’s Account, in same day funds, such Lender’s ratable portion of such Borrowing. After the Agent’s receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, the Agent will make such funds available to the applicable Borrower requesting the Borrowing at the Agent’s address referred to in Section 9.02 or, in the case of a Borrowing in a Committed Currency, at the applicable Payment Office, as the case may be.
(b)    Anything in subsection (a) above to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) no Borrower may select Eurocurrency Rate Advances for any Borrowing if the aggregate amount of such Borrowing is less than $5,000,000 (or the Equivalent thereof in a Committed Currency) or if the obligation of the applicable Lenders to make Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall then be suspended pursuant to Section 2.08 or 2.12 and (ii) the Eurocurrency Rate Advances may not be outstanding as part of more than twenty separate Borrowings.
(c)    Each Notice of Borrowing of any Borrower shall be irrevocable and binding on such Borrower. In the case of any Borrowing that the related Notice of Borrowing specifies is to be comprised of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, the applicable Borrower requesting such Borrowing shall indemnify each applicable Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the date specified in such Notice of Borrowing for such Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, including, without limitation, any loss (excluding loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such Borrowing when such Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.
(d)    Unless the Agent shall have received notice from an applicable Lender prior to the time of any Borrowing, except with respect to Borrowings pursuant to Section 2.03(c), that such Lender will not make available to the Agent such Lender’s ratable portion of such Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 2.02 and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower proposing the Borrowing on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Agent, such Lender agrees to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to such Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent provided, however, that if such Lender does not repay the Agent such Borrower agrees to repay the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, at (i) in the case of such Borrower, the higher of (A) the interest rate applicable at the time to the Advances comprising such Borrowing and (B) the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such amount and (ii) in the case of such Lender, (A) the Federal Funds Rate in the case of Advances denominated in Dollars or (B) the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such amount in the case of Advances denominated in Committed Currencies. If such Lender shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lender’s Advance as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.
(e)    The failure of any applicable Lender to make the Advance, except Advances made pursuant to Section 2.03(c), to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.

SECTION 2.03. Issuance of and Drawings and Reimbursement Under Letters of Credit. (a) Request for Issuance. Each Letter of Credit shall be issued upon notice, given not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day prior to the date of the proposed issuance of such Letter of Credit (or on such shorter notice as the applicable Issuing Bank may agree), by any Borrower to any Issuing Bank, and such Issuing Bank shall give the Agent, prompt notice thereof in writing. Each such notice of issuance of a Letter of Credit (a “Notice of Issuance”) shall be in writing, specifying therein the requested (i) date of such issuance (which shall be a Business Day), (ii) Available Amount and currency of such Letter of Credit, (iii) expiration date of such Letter of Credit (which expiration date shall not be later than the earlier of (x) 15 days prior to the latest Termination Date or (y) the date that is one year after the issuance thereof; provided that any such Letter of Credit which provides for automatic one-year extension(s) of such expiration date shall be deemed to comply with the foregoing requirement if the applicable Issuing Bank has the unconditional right to prevent any such automatic extension from taking place and each Issuing Bank hereby agrees to exercise such right to prevent any such automatic extension for each such Letter of Credit outstanding after the Termination Date; and provided, further, that the expiration date of a Special Letter of Credit shall be determined as set forth in Section 2.01(b)), (iv) name and address of the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit and (v) form of such Letter of Credit, and shall be accompanied by such customary application as such Issuing Bank may specify to the Borrower requesting such issuance for use in connection with such requested Letter of Credit. If the requested form of such Letter of Credit is acceptable to such Issuing Bank in its sole discretion, such Issuing Bank will, upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, make such Letter of Credit available to the Borrower requesting such issuance at its office referred to in Section 9.02 or as otherwise agreed with such Borrower in connection with such issuance. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by a Borrower to, or entered into by a Borrower with, the Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.
(b)    Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Lenders, such Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender’s Ratable Share of the Available Amount of such Letter of Credit. Each Borrower hereby agrees to each such participation. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Agent, for the account of such Issuing Bank, such Lender’s Ratable Share of each drawing made under a Letter of Credit funded by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the applicable Borrower on the date made, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to any Borrower for any reason, which amount will be advanced, and deemed to be an Advance to such Borrower hereunder, regardless of the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 3.03. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Lender further acknowledges and agrees that its participation in each Letter of Credit will be automatically adjusted to reflect such Lender’s Ratable Share of the Available Amount of such Letter of Credit at each time such Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment is amended pursuant to an assignment in accordance with Section 9.07 or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding sentences of this Section 2.03(b), (i) each Lender’s obligation to acquire participations pursuant thereto with respect to any Special Letter of Credit shall expire on the day that is 15 days prior to the Termination Date and (ii) each Lender’s existing participation, if any, pursuant thereto with respect to any Special Letter of Credit shall terminate on the day that is 15 days prior to the Termination Date.
(c)    Drawing and Reimbursement. The payment by an Issuing Bank of a draft drawn under any Letter of Credit shall constitute for all purposes of this Agreement the making by any such Issuing Bank of a Advance (and shall be made whether or not the conditions set forth in Section 3.03 have been satisfied; it being understood that no representations or warranties shall be made or deemed made by any Borrower in connection with such drawing), which, in the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in Dollars, shall be a Base Rate Advance, in the amount of such draft or, in the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in any currency other than Dollars, shall be a Base Rate Advance in the Equivalent in Dollars on the date such draft is paid. Each Issuing Bank shall give prompt notice (and such Issuing

19


Bank will use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver such notice within one Business Day) of each drawing under any Letter of Credit issued by it to the Company, the applicable Borrower (if not the Company) and the Agent. Upon written demand by such Issuing Bank to the Agent, with a copy of such demand to the Company, the Agent shall make demand on each Lender and each Lender shall pay to the Agent such Lender’s Ratable Share of such outstanding Advance, by making available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank, by deposit to the Agent’s Account, in same day funds, an amount equal to the portion of the outstanding principal amount of such Advance to be funded by such Lender. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to make Advances pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Agent shall transfer such funds to such Issuing Bank. Each Lender agrees to fund its Ratable Share of any such outstanding Advance on (i) the Business Day on which demand therefor is made by such Issuing Bank, provided that notice of such demand is given not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on such Business Day, or (ii) the first Business Day next succeeding such demand if notice of such demand is given after such time. If and to the extent that any Lender shall not have so made the amount of such Advance available to the Agent, such Lender agrees to pay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date of demand by any such Issuing Bank until the date such amount is paid to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate for its account or the account of such Issuing Bank, as applicable. If such Lender shall pay to the Agent such amount for the account of any such Issuing Bank on any Business Day, such amount so paid in respect of principal shall constitute an Advance made by such Lender on such Business Day for purposes of this Agreement, and the outstanding principal amount of such Advance made by such Issuing Bank shall be reduced by such amount on such Business Day. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding sentences of this Section 2.03(c): (x) each Lender’s obligation to pay its Ratable Share of any Advances pursuant thereto in respect of any Special Letters of Credit shall expire on the day that is 15 days prior to the Termination Date (the “Participation Cut-Off Date”); and (y) on and after the Participation Cut-Off Date, each drawing under a Special Letter of Credit shall be deemed not to constitute an Advance, but shall instead constitute an immediate obligation of the applicable Borrower to reimburse the full amount of such drawing, which obligation shall be satisfied to the extent that funds are on deposit in the special sub-account of the L/C Cash Deposit Account (as described in Section 2.10(c)) by application of such funds in accordance with Section 2.10(c).
(d)    Letter of Credit Reports. Each Issuing Bank shall furnish (A) to the Agent and each Lender on the first Business Day of each month a written report summarizing issuance and expiration dates of Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank during the preceding month and drawings during such month under all Letters of Credit and (B) to the Agent and each Lender (with a copy to the Company) on the first Business Day of each calendar quarter a written report setting forth the average daily aggregate Available Amount during the preceding calendar quarter of all Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank (including, in each case, the Dollar Equivalent of any Letter of Credit denominated in a Committed L/C Currency).
(e)    Failure to Make Advances. The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by it on the date specified in Section 2.03(c) shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to make its Advance on such date, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Advance to be made by such other Lender on such date.
SECTION 2.04. Fees. (a) Facility Fee. The Company agrees to pay to the Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee in Dollars on the aggregate amount of such Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment (irrespective of usage) from the Restatement Date in the case of each Initial Lender and from the effective date specified in the Assumption Agreement or in the Assignment and Assumption pursuant to which it became a Lender in the case of each other Lender until the Termination Date applicable to such Lender at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Percentage in effect from time to time, payable in arrears quarterly on the last day of each March, June, September and December, commencing December 31, 2019, and on the Termination Date applicable to such Lender; provided that no Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any facility fee in respect of its Revolving Credit Commitment for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Company shall not be required to pay such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender), other than a facility fee, as described

above, on the aggregate principal amount of Advances funded by such Defaulting Lender outstanding from time to time.
(b)    Letter of Credit Fees. (i) Each Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the account of each Lender a commission in Dollars on such Lender’s Ratable Share of the average daily aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit issued at the request of such Borrower and outstanding from time to time on or after the Restatement Date at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin for Eurocurrency Rate Advances in effect from time to time during such calendar quarter, payable in arrears quarterly on the third Business Day after the later of (a) receipt of an invoice for the letter of credit fees or (b) the last day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the quarter ended December 31, 2019, and on the Termination Date applicable to such Lender payable upon demand; provided, that no Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any commission in respect of Letters of Credit for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrowers shall not be required to pay such commission to that Defaulting Lender but shall pay such commission as set forth in Section 2.19); provided, further, that such commission shall be increased by 2% per annum upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default if the Borrowers are required to pay Default Interest pursuant to Section 2.07(b).
(ii)    Each Borrower shall pay to each Issuing Bank for its own account a fronting fee on the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank at the request of such Borrower and outstanding from time to time during each calendar quarter at a rate per annum equal to 0.25% payable in arrears quarterly on the third Business Day after the later of (a) receipt of an invoice for the fronting fee or (b) the last day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the quarter ended December 31, 2019, and on the Termination Date applicable to such Issuing Bank payable upon demand.
(c)    Agent’s Fees. The Company shall pay to the Agent for its own account such fees as may from time to time be agreed between the Company and the Agent.
SECTION 2.05. Optional Termination or Reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments. (a) Ratable Reduction. The Company shall have the right, upon at least three Business Days’ notice to the Agent, permanently to terminate in whole or to reduce ratably in part the unused portions of the respective Revolving Credit Commitments of the Lenders, provided that each partial reduction shall be in the aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.
(b)    Non-Ratable Reduction. The Company shall have the right, at any time, upon at least three Business Days’ notice to a Defaulting Lender (with a copy to the Agent), to terminate in whole such Defaulting Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment. Such termination shall be effective with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment on the date set forth in such notice, provided, however, that such date shall be no earlier than three Business Days after receipt of such notice. Upon termination of a Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment under this Section 2.05(b), the Borrowers will pay all principal of, and interest accrued to the date of such payment on, Advances owing to such Defaulting Lender and pay any accrued facility fee payable to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.04(a), and all other amounts then payable to such Defaulting Lender hereunder (including, but not limited to, any increased costs, additional interest or other amounts owing under Section 2.11, any indemnification for Taxes under Section 2.14, and any compensation payments due as provided in Section 9.04(c)); and upon such payments, the obligations of such Defaulting Lender hereunder shall, by the provisions hereof, be released and discharged; provided, however, that (i) such Defaulting Lender’s rights under Sections 2.11, 2.14 and 9.04, and its obligations under Section 9.04(e) shall survive such release and discharge as to matters occurring prior to such date; and (ii) no claim that the Borrowers may have against such Defaulting Lender arising out of such Defaulting Lender’s default hereunder shall be released or impaired in any way.

(b)    Letter of Credit Reimbursements. The obligation of any Borrower under this Agreement to repay any Advance that results from payment of a drawing under a Letter of Credit shall be unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including, without limitation, the following circumstances (it being understood that any such payment by a Borrower is without prejudice to, and does not constitute a waiver of, any rights such Borrower might have or might acquire as a result of the payment by any Lender of any draft or the reimbursement by such Borrower thereof):

(vii)    any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of any Borrower’s obligations hereunder.
SECTION 2.07. Interest on Advances. (a) Scheduled Interest. Each Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Advance made to it and owing to each Lender from the date of such Advance until such principal amount shall be paid in full, at the following rates per annum:

(London time) on the second Business Day before the making of a Borrowing in sufficient amounts to fund their respective Advances as a part of such Borrowing during its Interest Period or (ii) the Eurocurrency Rate for any Interest Period for such Advances will not adequately reflect the cost to such Required Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their respective Eurocurrency Rate Advances for such Interest Period, the Agent shall forthwith so notify the Company and the Lenders, whereupon (A) the Borrower of such Eurocurrency Advances will, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, (1) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in Dollars, either (x) prepay such Advances or (y) Convert such Advances into Base Rate Advances and (2) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in any Committed Currency, either (x) prepay such Advances or (y) Convert such Advances into Base Rate Advances in the Equivalent amount of Dollars and (B) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into, Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.
(c)    If any Borrower shall fail to select the duration of any Interest Period for any Eurocurrency Rate Advances in accordance with the provisions contained in the definition of “Interest Period” in Section 1.01, the Agent will forthwith so notify such Borrower and the Lenders and such Advances will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, (i) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in Dollars, Convert into Base Rate Advances and (ii) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in a Committed Currency, Converted into Base Rate Advances in the Equivalent amount of Dollars.
(d)    On the date on which the aggregate unpaid principal amount of Eurocurrency Rate Advances comprising any Borrowing shall be reduced, by payment or prepayment or otherwise, to less than $10,000,000 (or the Equivalent thereof in any Committed Currency), such Advances shall automatically (i) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in Dollars, Convert into Base Rate Advances and (ii) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in a Committed Currency, Convert into Base Rate Advances in the Equivalent amount of Dollars.
(e)    Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default under Section 6.01(a), (i) each Eurocurrency Rate Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, (A) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advance is denominated in Dollars, be Converted into a Base Rate Advance and (B) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advance is denominated in any Committed Currency, be Converted into a Base Rate Advance in the Equivalent amount of Dollars and (ii) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into, Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be suspended.
(f)    If the applicable Bloomberg screen is unavailable and the substitute or successor pages or screens are also unavailable,
(i)    the Agent shall forthwith notify the Company and the Lenders that the interest rate cannot be determined for such Eurocurrency Rate Advances,

Interpublic Credit Agreement
23


(ii)    with respect to Eurocurrency Rate Advances, each such Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, (A) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advance is denominated in Dollars, be prepaid by the applicable Borrower or be automatically Converted into a Base Rate Advance and (B) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advance is denominated in any Committed Currency, be prepaid by the applicable Borrower or be automatically Converted into a Base Rate Advance in the Equivalent amount of Dollars, and
(iii)    the obligation of the Lenders to make Eurocurrency Rate Advances or to Convert Base Rate Advances into Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.
(g)    If the Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the Required Lenders notify the Agent (with a copy to the Company) that the Required Lenders have determined, that (i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurocurrency Rate for such Eurocurrency Rate Advance, including, without limitation, because LIBOR is not available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or (ii) the supervisor for the administrator of LIBOR or a governmental authority having jurisdiction over the Agent has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which LIBOR shall no longer be made available, or used for determining the interest rate of loans, then, promptly after such determination by the Agent or receipt by the Agent of such notice, as applicable, the Agent and the Company may amend this Agreement to replace the Eurocurrency Rate with an alternate benchmark rate (including any mathematical or other adjustments to the benchmark (if any) incorporated therein) that has been broadly accepted by the syndicated loan market in the United States in lieu of LIBOR (any such proposed rate, a “LIBOR Successor Rate”), together with any proposed LIBOR Successor Rate Conforming Changes and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 9.01, any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on the fifth Business Day after the Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Company unless, prior to such time, the Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Agent notice that such Required Lenders do not accept such amendment; provided that, if such LIBOR Successor Rate as so determined would be less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero for the purposes of this Agreement. If no LIBOR Successor Rate has been determined and the circumstances under clause (i) above exist, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Advances or Interest Periods). Upon receipt of such notice, any Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Advances (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Advances or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Advances in the amount specified therein (or, in the case or a request for a Borrowing denominated in a Committed Currency, in the amount equal to the Equivalent thereof in Dollars).
SECTION 2.09. Optional Conversion of Advances. The Borrower of any Advance may on any Business Day, upon notice given to the Agent not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Conversion and subject to the provisions of Sections 2.08 and 2.12, Convert all or any part of such Advances denominated in Dollars of one Type comprising the same Borrowing into Advances denominated in Dollars of the other Type; provided, however, that any Conversion of Eurocurrency Rate Advances into Base Rate Advances shall be made only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurocurrency Rate Advances, any Conversion of Base Rate Advances into Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be in an amount not less than the minimum amount specified in Section 2.02(b) and no Conversion of any such Advances shall result in more separate Borrowings than permitted under Section 2.02(b). Each such notice of a Conversion shall, within the restrictions specified above, specify (i) the date of such Conversion, (ii) the Dollar denominated Advances to be Converted, and (iii) if such Conversion is into Eurocurrency Rate Advances, the duration of the initial Interest Period for each such Advance. Each notice of Conversion shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower giving such notice.

SECTION 2.10. Prepayments of Advances. (a) Optional. Each Borrower may, upon notice at least two Business Days prior to the date of such prepayment, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, and not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date of such prepayment, in the case of Base Rate Advances, to the Agent stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment, and if such notice is given such Borrower shall, prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Advances comprising part of the same Borrowing in whole or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid; provided, however, that (x) each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof in the case of Advances denominated in Dollars and the Equivalent of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof in the case of Advances denominated in any Committed Currencies (determined on the date notice of prepayment is given) and (y) in the event of any such prepayment of a Eurocurrency Rate Advance, such Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 9.04(c).
(b)    Mandatory Prepayments. (i) If the Agent notifies the Company on the second Business Day prior to any interest payment date that the sum of (A) the aggregate principal amount of all Advances denominated in Dollars plus the Available Amount of Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars then outstanding plus (B) the Equivalent in Dollars (both (A) and (B) determined on the third Business Day prior to such interest payment date) of the aggregate principal amount of all Advances denominated in Committed Currencies plus the Available Amount of all Letters of Credit denominated in Committed L/C Currencies then outstanding exceeds 105% of the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments of the Lenders on such date, the Borrowers shall, within two Business Days after receipt of such notice, prepay the outstanding principal amount of any Advances owing by the Borrowers in an aggregate amount sufficient to reduce such sum after such payment to an amount not to exceed 100% of the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments of the Lenders. The Agent shall provide such notice to the Company at the request of any Lender.
(ii)    Each prepayment made pursuant to this Section 2.10(b) shall be made together with any interest accrued to the date of such prepayment on the principal amounts prepaid and, in the case of any prepayment of a Eurocurrency Rate Advance on a date other than the last day of an Interest Period or at its maturity, any additional amounts which the Borrowers shall be obligated to reimburse to the Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 9.04(c). The Agent shall give prompt notice of any prepayment required under this Section 2.10(b) to the Company and the Lenders.
(c)    Letters of Credit. (i) The Company shall, on the day that is 15 days prior to the Termination Date, pay to the Agent for deposit in the regular sub-account of the L/C Cash Deposit Account an amount sufficient to cause the aggregate amount on deposit in the regular sub-account of the L/C Cash Deposit Account to equal the sum of (a) 105% of the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit, other than Special Letters of Credit, then outstanding denominated in any Committed L/C Currency other than Dollars and (b) 100% of the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit, other than Special Letters of Credit, then outstanding denominated in Dollars. Upon the drawing of any such Letter of Credit, to the extent funds are on deposit in the regular sub-account of the L/C Cash Deposit Account, such funds shall be applied to reimburse the applicable Issuing Banks to the extent permitted by applicable law, and if so applied, then such reimbursement shall be deemed a repayment of the corresponding Advance in respect of such Letter of Credit. After all such Letters of Credit shall have expired or been fully drawn upon and all other obligations of the Borrowers thereunder shall have been paid in full, the balance, if any, in such regular sub-account of the L/C Cash Deposit Account in respect of such Letters of Credit shall be promptly returned to the Company.
(ii)    The Company shall, on the day that is 105 days prior to the Termination Date, pay to the Agent for deposit in the special sub-account of the L/C Cash Deposit Account established for each Issuing Bank that has issued an outstanding Special Letter of Credit (against which such Issuing Bank and its Affiliates shall have rights of setoff with respect to any obligations, whether matured or contingent, in respect of Special Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank) an amount sufficient to cause the aggregate amount, denominated in the same currency or currencies in which the respective Special Letters of Credit then outstanding are denominated, on deposit in such special sub-account of the L/C Cash Deposit Account to equal 100% of the aggregate Available Amount of all Special Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank then outstanding. Upon the drawing of any Special Letter of Credit, to the extent funds are on deposit in the applicable special sub-account of the L/C Cash Deposit Account in respect of such Special Letter of Credit, such funds shall be applied (prior to the application of any other funds) to reimburse the Issuing Bank

Interpublic Credit Agreement
25


of such Letter of Credit to the extent permitted by applicable law, and if so applied, then such reimbursement shall be deemed a repayment of the corresponding Advance in respect of such Letter of Credit. After all Special Letters of Credit shall have expired or been fully drawn upon and all other obligations of the Borrowers thereunder shall have been paid in full, the balance, if any, in such special sub-account of the L/C Cash Deposit Account in respect of Special Letters of Credit shall be promptly returned to the Company.
SECTION 2.11. Increased Costs. (a) If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation after the date hereof or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request issued after the date hereof by any central bank or other governmental authority including, without limitation, any agency of the European Union or similar monetary or multinational authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender of agreeing to make or making, continuing, converting to, funding or maintaining Eurocurrency Rate Advances or agreeing to issue or of issuing or maintaining or participating in Letters of Credit (excluding for purposes of this Section 2.11 any such increased costs resulting from (i) Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which Section 2.14 shall govern) or Taxes described in Section 2.14(a)(iv) through (vii) and (ii) Other Connection Taxes that are imposed on or measured by net income (however denominated) or that are franchise Taxes or branch profits Taxes), then the Company shall from time to time, within 10 days of demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased cost. A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to the Company and the Agent by such Lender, shall constitute prima facie evidence of such amounts.
(b)    If any Lender determines that due to the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) after the date hereof, taking into consideration the policies of such Lender and any corporation controlling such Lender with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity requirements, increases or would increase the amount of capital or liquidity required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender and that the amount of such increase is based upon the existence of such Lender’s commitment to lend or to issue or participate in Letters of Credit hereunder and other commitments of this type and the effect of such increase is to reduce the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of the corporation controlling such Lender, then, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), the Company shall pay within 10 days of such demand to the Agent for the account of such Lender, from time to time as specified by such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender or such corporation in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Lender reasonably determines such increase in capital or liquidity to be allocable to the existence of such Lender’s commitment to lend or to issue or participate in Letters of Credit hereunder. A certificate as to such amounts submitted to the Company and the Agent by such Lender shall constitute prima facie evidence of such amounts.
(c)    If any governmental authority of the jurisdiction of any Committed Currency or Committed L/C Currency (or any other jurisdiction in which the funding operations of any Lender shall be conducted with respect to such Committed Currency or Committed L/C Currency) shall introduce or increase any reserve, liquid asset or similar requirement after the date hereof with respect to any category of deposits or liabilities customarily used to fund loans in such Committed Currency or Committed L/C Currency, or by reference to which interest rates applicable to loans in such Committed Currency or Committed L/C Currency are determined, and the result of such requirement shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Advance denominated in a Committed Currency, and such Lender shall deliver to the relevant Borrowers a notice requesting compensation under this paragraph, then the relevant Borrowers will pay to such Lender within 10 days after each date on which interest is paid pursuant to Section 2.07 with respect to each affected Advance denominated in a Committed Currency, an amount that will compensate such Lender for such additional cost. A certificate in reasonable detail as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to the Company and the Agent by such Lender shall constitute prima facie evidence of such amounts.
(d)    For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Section 2.11, any changes resulting from requests, rules, guidelines or directives (x) issued by any governmental authority in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or (y) promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued, shall be subject to

Interpublic Credit Agreement
26


subsections (a), (b) and (c) above provided that the Lender making any claim under any such subsection shall have given the Company at least 30 days prior notice of such change(s).
(e)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, no Lender shall demand compensation for any increased cost or reduction pursuant to this Section if it shall not at the time be the general policy or practice of such Lender to demand such compensation in similar circumstances under comparable provisions of other credit agreements.
SECTION 2.12. Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Lender shall notify the Agent that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation after the date hereof makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority asserts after the date hereof that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its Eurocurrency Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurocurrency Rate Advances in Dollars or any Committed Currency or to fund or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Advances in Dollars or any Committed Currency hereunder, (a) each Eurocurrency Rate Advance funded by such Lender will automatically, upon such demand, (i) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advance is denominated in Dollars, be Converted into a Base Rate Advance and (ii) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advance is denominated in any Committed Currency, be Converted into a Base Rate Advance in the Equivalent amount of Dollars and (b) the obligation of such Lender to make Eurocurrency Rate Advances or to Convert Advances into Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.
SECTION 2.13. Payments and Computations. (a) Each Borrower shall make each payment hereunder, except with respect to principal of, interest on, and other amounts relating to, Advances denominated in a Committed Currency or Committed L/C Currency, not later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the day when due in Dollars to the Agent at the applicable Agent’s Account in same day funds and without deduction, set off or counterclaim. Each Borrower shall make each payment hereunder with respect to principal of, interest on, and other amounts relating to, Advances denominated in a Committed Currency, not later than 9:30 A.M. (at the Payment Office for such Committed Currency) on the day when due in such Committed Currency to the Agent, by deposit of such funds to the applicable Agent’s Account in same day funds and without deduction, set off or counterclaim. The Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest, fees or commissions ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.04(b)(ii), 2.11, 2.14 or 9.04(c)) to the Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon any Assuming Lender becoming a Lender hereunder as a result of a Commitment Increase pursuant to Section 2.18 or an extension of the Termination Date pursuant to Section 2.20, and upon the Agent’s receipt of such Lender’s Assumption Agreement and recording of the information contained therein in the Register, from and after the applicable Increase Date or Anniversary Date, as the case may be, the Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under any Notes issued in connection therewith in respect of the interest assumed thereby to the Assuming Lender. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Assumption and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 9.07(c), from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Assumption, the Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under any Notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Assumption shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.
(b)    All computations of interest based on the Base Rate shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, all computations of interest based on the Eurocurrency Rate or the Federal Funds Rate and of fees and Letter of Credit commissions shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days with twelve 30-day months (or, in each case of Advances denominated in Committed Currencies where market practice differs, in accordance with market practice), in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest, fees or commissions are payable. Each determination by the Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

Interpublic Credit Agreement
27


(c)    Whenever any payment hereunder or under any Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest, fee or commission, as the case may be; provided, however, that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurocurrency Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.
(d)    Unless the Agent shall have received notice from any Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent such Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Agent, at (i) the Federal Funds Rate in the case of Advances denominated in Dollars or (ii) the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such amount in the case of Advances denominated in Committed Currencies.
(e)    To the extent that the Agent receives funds for application to the amounts owing by any Borrower under or in respect of this Agreement or any Note in currencies other than the currency or currencies required to enable the Agent to distribute funds to the Lenders in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.13, the Agent shall be entitled to convert or exchange such funds into Dollars or into a Committed Currency or from Dollars to a Committed Currency or from a Committed Currency to Dollars, as the case may be, to the extent necessary to enable the Agent to distribute such funds in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.13; provided that each Borrower and each of the Lenders hereby agree that the Agent shall not be liable or responsible for any loss, cost or expense suffered by such Borrower or such Lender as a result of any conversion or exchange of currencies effected pursuant to this Section 2.13(e) or as a result of the failure of the Agent to effect any such conversion or exchange provided such failure was not a result of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Agent; and provided further that the applicable Borrower agrees to indemnify the Agent and each Lender, and hold the Agent and each Lender harmless, but without duplication, for any and all losses, costs and expenses incurred by the Agent or any Lender for any conversion or exchange of currencies (or the failure to convert or exchange any currencies) in accordance with this Section 2.13(e), provided such losses, costs and expenses were not the result of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Agent.
SECTION 2.14. Taxes. (a) Subject to Sections 2.14(e) and 2.14(g), any and all payments by each Borrower hereunder or under any Notes shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.13, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings imposed by any governmental authority, and all liabilities with respect thereto (“Taxes”), excluding, (i) in the case of each Lender and the Agent, taxes imposed on its overall net income, and franchise Taxes imposed on it in lieu of net income Taxes, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) is organized or any political subdivision thereof, (ii) in the case of each Lender, Taxes imposed on its overall net income, and franchise Taxes imposed on it in lieu of net income Taxes, by the jurisdiction of such Lender’s Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof, (iii) in the case of each Lender and the Agent, Taxes imposed as a result of a present or former connection between such Lender or the Agent and the jurisdiction imposing such Tax (other than connections arising from such Lender or the Agent having executed, delivered, become a party to, performed its obligations under, received payments under, received or perfected a security interest under, engaged in any other transaction pursuant to or enforced any Loan Document, or sold or assigned an interest in any Loan Document) (such Taxes herein referred to as “Other Connection Taxes”), (iv) in the case of any Lender, United States federal withholding Taxes imposed on amounts payable to or for the account of such Lender with respect to an applicable interest in a Commitment pursuant to a law in effect on the date on which (A) such Lender acquires an interest in the Commitment (other than pursuant to an assignment request by the Company under Section 2.21) or (B) such Lender changes its lending office, except in each case to the extent that, pursuant to this Section 2.14, amounts with respect to such Taxes were payable either to such assignor immediately before such Lender became a party hereto or to such Lender immediately before it changed its lending office, (v) any United States federal backup withholding Tax, (vi) any withholding Tax imposed as a result of the failure to comply with the requirements of FATCA, and (vii) any Tax, assessment or other governmental charge

28


that would not have been imposed but for a failure by each Lender or the Agent, or any other legal or beneficial holder or any foreign financial institution through which payments on the Borrowings under this Agreement are made to comply with any applicable certification, documentation, information or other reporting requirement concerning the nationality, residence, identity, direct or indirect ownership of or investment in, or connection with the United States of America of the applicable Lender, the Agent, or any other legal or beneficial holder or any foreign financial institution through which payments on the Borrowings under this Agreement are made if such compliance is required by statute or regulation of the United States as a precondition to relief or exemption from such Tax, assessment or other governmental charge (all such excluded Taxes referred to as “Excluded Taxes” and all such non‑excluded Taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities in respect of payments hereunder or under any Notes being hereinafter referred to as “Indemnified Taxes”). If any Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any Note to any Lender or the Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.14) such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law.
(b)    In addition, the Company shall pay any present or future stamp or documentary Taxes or any other excise or property Taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or under any Notes or from the execution, delivery or registration of, performing under, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any Notes (hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”).
(c)    Subject to Sections 2.14(e) and 2.14(g), each Borrower shall indemnify each Lender and the Agent for and hold it harmless against the full amount of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) that the Borrower is required to pay pursuant to this Section 2.14 and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor.
(d)    Within 45 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, each Borrower shall furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing such payment to the extent such a receipt is issued therefor, or other written proof of payment thereof that is reasonably satisfactory to the Agent. In the case of any payment hereunder or under any Notes by or on behalf of such Borrower through an account or branch outside the United States or by or on behalf of such Borrower by a payor that is not a United States person, if such Borrower determines that no Taxes are payable in respect thereof, such Borrower shall furnish, or shall cause such payor to furnish, to the Agent, at such address, an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Agent stating that such payment is exempt from Taxes. For purposes of this subsection (d) and subsection (e), the terms “United States” and “United States person” shall have the meanings specified in Section 7701 of the Internal Revenue Code.
(e)    (i) Each Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Initial Lender and on the date of the Assumption Agreement or the Assignment and Assumption pursuant to which it becomes a Lender in the case of each other Lender, and from time to time thereafter as requested in writing by the Company (but only so long as such Lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide each of the Agent and the Company with two copies of Internal Revenue Service forms W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI (or a Form W-8IMY with supporting forms attached), as appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Lender is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of United States withholding tax on payments pursuant to this Agreement or any Notes. If any form or document referred to in this subsection (e) requires the disclosure of information, other than information necessary to compute the tax payable and information required on the date hereof by Internal Revenue Service form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI or W-8IMY, that the Lender reasonably considers to be confidential, the Lender shall give notice thereof to the Borrowers and shall not be obligated to include in such form or document such confidential information.

Interpublic Credit Agreement
29


(ii)    If a payment made to a Lender hereunder would be subject to United States federal withholding tax pursuant to FATCA, if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA, such Lender shall deliver to the Company and the Agent, at the appropriate time any documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent as may be necessary for the Borrowers or the Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine whether withholding under FATCA is required.
(f)    Each Lender that is a United States person shall, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Initial Lender and on the date of the Assumption Agreement or the Assignment and Assumption pursuant to which it becomes a Lender in the case of each other Lender, and from time to time thereafter as reasonably requested in writing by the Agent or the Company, provide each of the Agent and the Company with two copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 certifying that it is not subject to backup withholding. If such Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, such Lender shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Agent and the Company in writing of its legal inability to do so.
(g)    For any period with respect to which a Lender has failed to provide the Company with the appropriate form, certificate or other document described in Section 2.14(e) (other than if such failure is due to a change in law, or in the interpretation or application thereof, occurring subsequent to the date on which a form, certificate or other document originally was required to be provided, or if such form, certificate or other document otherwise is not required under subsection (e) above), such Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification or a gross up under Section 2.14(a) or (c) with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States by reason of such failure, including any United States federal withholding tax imposed as a result of a failure to satisfy the applicable requirements of FATCA; provided, however, that should a Lender become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form, certificate or other document required hereunder, the Company shall take such steps at such Lender’s expense as the Lender shall reasonably request to assist the Lender to recover such Taxes.
(h)    Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.14 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Eurocurrency Lending Office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.
SECTION 2.15. Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set‑off, or otherwise) on account of the Advances owing to it (other than (x) as payment of an Advance made by an Issuing Bank pursuant to the first sentence of Section 2.03(c) or (y) pursuant to Section 2.11, 2.14 or 9.04(c)) in excess of its Ratable Share of payments on account of the Advances obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Advances owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.15 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set‑off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.

SECTION 2.16. Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Advance owing to such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder in respect of Advances. Each Borrower agrees that upon notice by any Lender to such Borrower (with a copy of such notice to the Agent) to the effect that a Note is required or appropriate in order for such Lender to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or otherwise) the Advances owing to, or to be made by, such Lender, such Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such Lender a Note payable to the order of such Lender in a principal amount up to the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender.
(b)    The Register maintained by the Agent pursuant to Section 9.07(c) shall include a control account, and a subsidiary account for each Lender, in which accounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the date and amount of each Borrowing made hereunder, the Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing and, if appropriate, the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the terms of each Assumption Agreement and each Assignment and Assumption delivered to and accepted by it, (iii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iv) the amount of any sum received by the Agent from such Borrower hereunder and each Lender’s share thereof.
(c)    Entries made in good faith by the Agent in the Register pursuant to subsection (b) above, and by each Lender in its account or accounts pursuant to subsection (a) above, shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to, in the case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case of such account or accounts, such Lender, under this Agreement, absent manifest error; provided, however, that the failure of the Agent or such Lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of any Borrower under this Agreement.
SECTION 2.17. Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Advances shall be available (and each Borrower agrees that it shall use such proceeds) solely for general corporate purposes of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, including acquisition financing. Each of the Borrowers represents and covenants that no Advance or Letter of Credit, nor the proceeds from any Advance or Letter of Credit, will be used directly or, to its knowledge, indirectly, (a) in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization of the payment or giving of money, or anything else of value, to any Person in material violation of any Anti-Corruption Laws, (b) for the purpose of funding or financing any activities, business or transaction of or with any Sanctioned Person, or in any Sanctioned Country, except in accordance with valid and effective licenses and permits issued by the government of the United States or otherwise in accordance with applicable law or (c) in any manner that would result in the violation of any Sanctions applicable to the Borrowers, or to the knowledge to the Borrowers, any other party hereto.
SECTION 2.18. Increase in the Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments. (a) The Company may, at any time but in any event not more than once in any calendar year prior to the latest Termination Date, by notice to the Agent, request that the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments be increased by an amount of $25,000,000 or an integral multiple of $5,000,000 in excess thereof (each a “Commitment Increase”) to be effective as of a date that is at least 90 days prior to the latest scheduled Termination Date then in effect (the “Increase Date”) as specified in the related notice to the Agent; provided, however that (i) in no event shall the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments at any time be increased by more than $250,000,000 above the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments as of the Restatement Date and (ii) on the related Increase Date the applicable conditions set forth in Article III shall be satisfied.
(b)    The Agent shall promptly notify the Non-Defaulting Lenders and such other Persons that satisfy the definition of Eligible Assignee as the Company may identify of a request by the Company for a Commitment Increase, which notice shall include (i) the proposed amount of such requested Commitment Increase, (ii) the proposed Increase Date and (iii) the date by which Non-Defaulting Lenders and such other Persons wishing to participate in the Commitment Increase must commit to an increase in the amount of their respective Revolving Credit Commitments (with respect to any proposed Commitment Increase, the “Commitment Date”). Each Non-Defaulting Lender that is willing to participate in such requested Commitment Increase (each an “Increasing Lender”) and each such other Person that is willing to participate in such requested Commitment Increase (each such Eligible Assignee and each Eligible

Interpublic Credit Agreement
31


Assignee that shall become a party hereto in accordance with Section 2.20, an “Assuming Lender”) shall, in its sole discretion, give written notice to the Agent on or prior to the Commitment Date of the amount by which it is willing to participate in such Commitment Increase; provided, however, that the Revolving Credit Commitment of each such Assuming Lender shall be in an amount of $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Promptly following each Commitment Date, the Agent shall notify the Company as to the amount, if any, by which the Increasing Lenders and Assuming Lenders are willing to participate in the requested Commitment Increase. If the Increasing Lenders and Assuming Lenders notify the Agent that they are willing to increase the amount of their respective Revolving Credit Commitments by an aggregate amount that exceeds the amount of the requested Commitment Increase, the requested Commitment Increase shall be allocated among the Increasing Lenders and Assuming Lenders willing to participate therein in such amounts as are agreed between the Company and the Agent; provided that (x) the Company may in its discretion determine that such allocation shall be made pro rata among the Increasing Lenders and the Assuming Lenders, based on the ratio of each such Person’s proposed participation in the Commitment Increase to the aggregate amount of all such proposed participations and (y) the resulting increased Revolving Credit Commitments of the Increasing Lenders and the Assuming Lenders shall be subject to the approval of each Issuing Bank (which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Agent shall promptly notify the Increasing Lenders and each Assuming Lender of the results of any such allocation of the Commitment Increase.
(c)    On each Increase Date, each Assuming Lender shall become a Lender party to this Agreement as of such Increase Date and the Revolving Credit Commitment of each Increasing Lender for such requested Commitment Increase shall be so increased by such amount (or by the amount allocated to such Lender pursuant to the last sentence of Section 2.18(b)) as of such Increase Date; provided, however, that the Agent shall have received on or before such Increase Date the following, each dated such date:
(i)    (A) certified copies of resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company or the Executive Committee of such Board approving the Commitment Increase and the corresponding modifications to this Agreement and (B) an opinion of counsel for the Company (which may be in-house counsel), in substantially the form of Exhibit D-2 hereto;
(ii)    an assumption agreement from each Assuming Lender, if any, in substantially the form of Exhibit F hereto (each an “Assumption Agreement”), duly executed by such Assuming Lender, the Agent and the Company; and
(iii)    confirmation from each Increasing Lender of the increase in the amount of its Revolving Credit Commitment in a writing satisfactory to the Company and the Agent.
On each Increase Date, upon fulfillment of the conditions set forth in the immediately preceding sentence of this Section 2.18(c), the Agent shall notify the Lenders (including, without limitation, each Assuming Lender) and the Company, on or before 1:00 P.M. (New York City time), in writing, of the occurrence of the Commitment Increase to be effected on such Increase Date and shall record in the Register the relevant information with respect to each Increasing Lender and each Assuming Lender on such date. Each Increasing Lender and each Assuming Lender shall, as of the Increase Date, fund their respective Ratable Shares of each Borrowing then outstanding, which funds the Agent shall distribute to the other Lenders to effect a funding of each such Borrowing by each of the Lenders (including the Increasing Lenders and the Assuming Lenders) ratably in accordance with their Ratable Shares after giving effect to the applicable Commitment Increase and, if the applicable Increase Date is not the last day of an Interest Period, the Company shall be obligated to reimburse the Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 9.04(c).

SECTION 2.19. Defaulting Lenders.
(a)If at the time a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Section 6.01 or otherwise) or received by the Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 9.05 or 9.07(b)(vii) shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to any Issuing Bank hereunder; third, to the L/C Cash Deposit Account to cash collateralize the Issuing Banks’ fronting exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to Letters of Credit; fourth, as the Company may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Advance in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Agent; fifth if so determined by the Agent and the Company, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations with respect to Advances under this Agreement and (y) cash collateralize the Issuing Banks’ future fronting exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender or the Issuing Banks against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to any Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by such Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender's breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Borrowing or drawing under a Letter of Credit in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Borrowings were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 3.03 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Borrowings of, and drawings under Letters of Credit owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Borrowings of, or any drawings under any Letter of Credit owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Borrowings and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Revolving Credit Commitments without giving effect to Section 2.19(b)(i), it being understood that any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or paid into the L/C Case Deposit Account pursuant to this Section 2.19(a) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto;
(b)If any Letters of Credit are outstanding at the time a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, and the Commitments have not been terminated in accordance with Section 6.01, then:
(i)    so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, all or any part of the Available Amount of outstanding Letters of Credit (except in the case where the applicable Issuing Bank is the Defaulting Lender) shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Ratable Shares (excluding from the determination thereof any Defaulting Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment) but only to the extent that the sum of (A) the aggregate principal amount of all Advances made by such Non-Defaulting Lenders (in their capacity as Lenders) and outstanding at such time, plus (B) such Non-Defaulting Lenders’ Ratable Shares (before giving effect to the reallocation contemplated herein) of the Available Amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit, plus (C) the aggregate principal amount of all Advances made by each Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.03(c) that have not been ratably funded by such Non-Defaulting Lenders and outstanding at such time, plus (D) such Defaulting Lender’s Ratable Share of the Available Amount of such Letters of Credit, does not exceed the total of all Non-Defaulting Lenders’ Revolving Credit Commitments;
(ii)    if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrowers and each Issuing Bank that is a Non-Defaulting Lender shall enter into such arrangements as are reasonably satisfactory to the Borrowers and such Issuing Bank in order (after giving effect to any partial

Interpublic Credit Agreement
33


reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) reasonably to mitigate the remaining risk with respect to such Defaulting Lender to the applicable Issuing Bank for so long as such Letters of Credit are outstanding;
(iii)    if the Ratable Shares of Letters of Credit of the Non-Defaulting Lenders are reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.19(b), then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.04(b)(i) shall be adjusted in accordance with such Non-Defaulting Lenders’ Ratable Shares of Letters of Credit and, to the extent not so reallocated, shall be allocated to the Issuing Bank or retained by the Borrowers as agreed pursuant to clause (ii) above.
(c)So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, renew or increase any Letter of Credit unless it is reasonably satisfied that the related exposure will be 100% covered by the Revolving Credit Commitments of the Non-Defaulting Lenders or the provisions of Section 2.19(b)(ii) have been complied with, and participating interests in any such newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among Non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.19(b)(i) (and Defaulting Lenders shall not participate therein).
(d)No Commitment of any Lender shall be increased or otherwise affected, and, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 2.19, performance by the Borrowers of their obligations hereunder shall not be excused or otherwise modified as a result of the operation of this Section 2.19. Subject to Section 9.18, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender. The rights and remedies against a Defaulting Lender under this Section 2.19 are in addition to any other rights and remedies which the Borrowers, the Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender (including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender’s increased exposure following the reallocation described in subsection (b)(i) above).
(e)If the Company, the Agent and each Issuing Bank agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, and the Company has not terminated the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender in accordance with Section 2.05(b), the Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with the Commitments (without giving effect to Section 2.19(b)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.

SECTION 2.20. Extension of Termination Date.
(a)Requests for Extension. The Company may, not more than twice, by written notice to the Agent (who shall promptly notify the Lenders) not earlier than 60 days and not later than 45 days prior to any anniversary of the Restatement Date (an “Anniversary Date”), request that each Lender extend such Lender’s Termination Date for an additional one year from the Termination Date then in effect with respect to such Lender.
(b)Lender Elections to Extend. Each Lender, acting in its sole and individual discretion, shall, by written notice to the Agent given not later than the date (the “Notice Date”) that is 15 days prior to such Anniversary Date, advise the Agent whether or not such Lender agrees to such extension (and each Lender that determines not to so extend its Termination Date (a “Non Extending Lender”) shall notify the Agent of such fact promptly after such determination (but in any event no later than the Notice Date) and any Lender that does not so advise the Agent on or before the Notice Date shall be deemed to be a Non‑Extending Lender). The election of any Lender to agree to such extension shall not obligate any other Lender to so agree.

Interpublic Credit Agreement
34


(c)Notification by Agent. The Agent shall notify the Company of each Lender’s determination under this Section no later than the date 10 days prior to the applicable Anniversary Date (or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the preceding Business Day).
(d)Additional Commitment Lenders. The Company shall have the right on or before the applicable Anniversary Date to replace each Non‑Extending Lender with, and add as “Lenders” under this Agreement in place thereof, one or more Eligible Assignees (as an Assuming Lender) with the approval of the Agent and each Issuing Bank (which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), each of which Assuming Lenders shall have entered into an Assumption Agreement pursuant to which such Assuming Lender shall, effective as of the applicable Anniversary Date, undertake a Commitment (and, if any such Assuming Lender is already a Lender, its Commitment shall be in addition to such Lender’s Commitment hereunder on such date).
(e)Minimum Extension Requirement. If (and only if) the total of the Commitments of the Lenders that have agreed so to extend their Termination Date and the additional Commitments of the Assuming Lenders shall be more than 50% of the aggregate amount of the Commitments in effect immediately prior to the applicable Anniversary Date, then, effective as of such Anniversary Date, the Termination Date of each Lender (other than a Non-Extending Lender) and of each Assuming Lender shall be extended to the date falling one year after the Termination Date in effect for such Lenders (except that, if such date is not a Business Day, such Termination Date as so extended shall be the preceding Business Day) and each Assuming Lender shall thereupon become a “Lender” for all purposes of this Agreement.
(f)Conditions to Effectiveness of Extensions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the extension of the Termination Date pursuant to this Section shall not be effective with respect to any Lender unless on the applicable Anniversary Date:
(x) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing on such date and after giving effect to such extension; and
(y) the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.01 of this Agreement are correct in all material respects (or, in the case of any such representation or warranty already qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect, in all respects) on and as of such date of such extension and after giving effect to such extension, as though made on and as of such date (or, if any such representation or warranty is expressly stated to have been made as of a specific date, as of such specific date).
SECTION 2.21. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(a)Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.11, or requires any Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any governmental authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.14, then such Lender shall (at the request of the Company) use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Advances hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.11 or 2.14, as the case may be, in the future, and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
(b)Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.11, or if any Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any governmental authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.14, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, or if any Lender becomes a Non-Consenting Lender, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Agent require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 9.07), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Section 2.11 or Section 2.14) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an

Interpublic Credit Agreement
35


Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that:
(i)    the Company shall have paid to the Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in Section 9.07;
(ii)    such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Advances and participations in L/C disbursements (if any), accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 9.04(c)) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts);
(iii)    in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.11 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.14, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter;
(iv)    in the case of any assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent; and
(v)    such assignment does not conflict with applicable law.
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

Interpublic Credit Agreement

Credit to be terminated, whereupon the same shall forthwith terminate, and (ii) shall at the request, or may with the consent, of the Required Lenders, by notice to the Company and the other Borrowers, declare the Advances, all interest thereon and all other amounts payable under this Agreement to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon such Advances, all such interest and all such amounts shall become and be forthwith due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by each Borrower; provided, however, that in the event of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to any Borrower under the Federal Bankruptcy Code, (A) the obligation of each Lender to make Advances (other than Advances by an Issuing Bank or a Lender pursuant to Section 2.03(c)), and of the Issuing Banks to issue Letters of Credit shall automatically be terminated and (B) such Advances, all such interest and all such amounts shall automatically become and be due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or any notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by each Borrower.
SECTION 6.02. Actions in Respect of the Letters of Credit upon Default. If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Agent may with the consent, or shall at the request, of the Required Lenders, irrespective of whether it is taking any of the actions described in Section 6.01 or otherwise, make demand upon the Company to, and forthwith upon such demand the Company will, (a) pay to the Agent on behalf of the Lenders in same day funds at the Agent’s office designated in such demand, for deposit in the applicable sub-account of the L/C Cash Deposit Account, an amount equal to the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit then outstanding or (b) make such other reasonable arrangements in respect of the outstanding Letters of Credit as shall be acceptable to the Required Lenders; provided, however, that in the event of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to any Borrower under the Federal Bankruptcy Code, an amount equal to the aggregate Available Amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit shall be immediately due and payable to the Agent for the account of the Lenders without notice to or demand upon the Borrowers, which are expressly waived by each Borrower, to be held in the L/C Cash Deposit Account. If at any time the Agent reasonably determines that any funds held in the L/C Cash Deposit Account are subject to any right or interest of any Person other than the Agent and the Lenders or that the total amount of such funds is less than the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit, the Borrowers will, forthwith upon demand by the Agent, pay to the Agent, as additional funds to be deposited and held in the L/C Cash Deposit Account, an amount equal to the excess of (x) such aggregate Available Amount over (y) the total amount of funds, if any, then held in the L/C Cash Deposit Account that are free and clear of any such right and interest. Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit when this Section 6.02 is applicable (and without prejudice to Section 2.10(c)) to the extent funds are on deposit in the L/C Cash Deposit Account, such funds shall be applied to reimburse the Issuing Banks to the extent permitted by applicable law, and if so applied, then such reimbursement shall be deemed a repayment of the corresponding Advance or reimbursement obligation in respect of such Letter of Credit. To the extent that any such Letter of Credit expires or otherwise terminates, and to the extent the applicable Issuing Bank’s liability has ceased to exist under such Letter of Credit, and funds are on deposit in the L/C Cash Deposit Account in respect of such Letter of Credit, an amount equal to the undrawn amounts under such Letter of Credit shall be promptly returned from such L/C Cash Deposit Account to the Company. If any Event of Default has been waived or otherwise cured and no other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the balance, if any, in the L/C Cash Deposit Account shall be promptly returned to the Company. If, in accordance with this Section 6.02, the balance in the L/C Cash Deposit Account has not been otherwise returned, then after all such Letters of Credit shall have expired or been fully drawn upon and all other obligations of the Borrowers hereunder and under the Notes shall have been paid in full, the balance, if any, in such L/C Cash Deposit Account shall be promptly returned to the Company.

GUARANTY
SECTION 7.01. Guaranty.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company’s liability shall extend to all amounts that constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations and would be owed by any such Borrower to the Agent or any Lender under or in respect of this Agreement or any Notes but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving such Borrower.
SECTION 7.02. Guaranty Absolute.

(b)    any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other obligations of any Borrower under or in respect of this Agreement or the Notes, if any, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from this Agreement or the Notes, if any, including, without limitation, any increase in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from the extension of additional credit to any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise;
(c)    any taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any taking, release or amendment or waiver of, or consent to departure from, any other guaranty, for all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations;
(d)    any manner of application of collateral, or proceeds thereof, to all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any manner of sale or other disposition of any collateral for all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other obligations of any Borrower under this Agreement or the Notes, if any, or any other assets of any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries;
(e)    any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate structure or existence of any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries;
(f)    any failure of any Lender or the Agent to disclose to the Company any information relating to the business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations, performance, properties or prospects of any Borrower now or hereafter known to such Lender or the Agent (the Company waiving any duty on the part of the Lenders and the Agent to disclose such information); or

Interpublic Credit Agreement
50


(g)    any other circumstance (including, without limitation, any statute of limitations) or any existence of or reliance on any representation by any Lender or the Agent that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Borrower or any other guarantor or surety.
This Article VII shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by any Lender or the Agent or any other Person upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.
SECTION 7.03. Waivers and Acknowledgments. (a) The Company hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance, presentment, demand for performance, notice of nonperformance, default, acceleration, protest or dishonor and any other notice with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations and this Article VII and any requirement that any Lender or the Agent protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien or any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against any Borrower or any other Person or any collateral.
(b)    The Company hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any right to revoke this Article VII and acknowledges that the guaranty under this Article VII is continuing in nature and applies to all Guaranteed Obligations, whether existing now or in the future.
(c)    The Company hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives (i) any defense arising by reason of any claim or defense based upon an election of remedies by any Lender or the Agent that in any manner impairs, reduces, releases or otherwise adversely affects the subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification rights of the Company or other rights of the Company to proceed against any Borrower, any other guarantor or any other Person or any collateral and (ii) any defense based on any right of set-off or counterclaim against or in respect of the obligations of the Company hereunder.
(d)    The Company hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any duty on the part of any Lender or the Agent to disclose to the Company any matter, fact or thing relating to the business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations, performance, properties or prospects of any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries now or hereafter known by such Lender or the Agent.
(e)     The Company acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by this Agreement and any Notes and that the waivers set forth in Section 7.02 and this Section 7.03 are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.
SECTION 7.04. Subrogation. The Company hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees not to exercise any rights that it may now have or hereafter acquire against any Borrower or any other insider guarantor that arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of the Company’s obligations under or in respect of this Article VII, including, without limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of any Lender or the Agent against any Borrower or any other insider guarantor or any collateral, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from any Borrower or any other insider guarantor, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim, remedy or right, unless and until all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Article VII shall have been paid in full in cash, all Letters of Credit (other than Special Letters of Credit) issued for the account of such Borrower shall have expired or been terminated and the Revolving Credit Commitments shall have expired or been terminated.

ARTICLE VIII
THE AGENT
SECTION 8.01. Authorization and Authority. Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereby irrevocably appoints Citibank to act on its behalf as the Agent hereunder and under the Notes and authorizes the Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Except as provided in Section 8.06, the provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, and neither the Company nor any Designated Subsidiary shall have rights as a third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term “agent” herein or in any Notes (or any other similar term) with reference to the Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.
SECTION 8.02. Rights as a Lender. The Person serving as the Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for, and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Company or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
SECTION 8.03. Exculpatory Provisions. (a) The Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agent:
(i)    shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;

Interpublic Credit Agreement
52


(ii)    shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein); provided that the Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Agent to liability or that is contrary to this Agreement or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any debtor relief law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any debtor relief law; and
(iii)    shall not, except as expressly set forth herein, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Company or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.
(b)    The Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 9.01 or 6.01), or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. The Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given to the Agent in writing by the Company, a Lender or an Issuing Bank.
(c)    The Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty, representation or other information made or supplied in or in connection with this Agreement or the Information Memorandum, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith or the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of the information contained therein, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document or the perfection or priority of any Lien or security interest created or purported to be created hereby or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article III or elsewhere herein, other than (but subject to the foregoing clause (ii)) to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Agent.
(d)    Nothing in this Agreement shall require the Agent or any of its Related Parties to carry out any “know your customer” or other checks in relation to any person on behalf of any Lender and each Lender confirms to the Agent that it is solely responsible for any such checks it is required to carry out and that it may not rely on any statement in relation to such checks made by the Agent or any of its Related Parties.
SECTION 8.04. Reliance by Agent. The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of an Advance, or the issuance, extension, renewal or increase of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or an Issuing Bank, the Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or Issuing Bank unless an officer of the Agent responsible for the transactions contemplated hereby shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or Issuing Bank prior to the making of such Advance or the issuance of such Letter of Credit, and in the case of a Borrowing, such Lender shall not have made available to the Agent such Lender’s ratable portion of such Borrowing. The Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Company), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.



Interpublic Credit Agreement

SECTION 8.05. Delegation of Duties. The Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any Note by or through any one or more sub‑agents appointed by the Agent, and the Agent and any such sub‑agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties, provided, in each case that no such delegation to a sub-agent or a Related Party shall release the Agent from any of its obligations hereunder. Each such sub‑agent and the Related Parties of the Agent and each such sub‑agent shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this Article VIII and Section 9.04 (as though such sub-agents were the “Agent” hereunder and under the Notes) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto.
SECTION 8.06. Resignation of Agent. (a) The Agent may at any time and, if the Person acting as the Agent is a Defaulting Lender and the Company so requests, the Agent shall promptly, give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Company. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Company so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in New York, New York. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation then the Company may (if the resignation is at the request of the Company) or the retiring Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, with the consent of the Company so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, appoint a successor Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective no earlier than three Business Days after the date in such notice (the “Resignation Effective Date”).
(b)    If the Person serving as Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (b) of the definition thereof, each of the Company and the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to such Person and, if such notice is given by the Required Lenders, to the Company, remove such Person as Agent and, the Required Lenders may, with the consent of the Company so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, appoint a successor. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the “Removal Effective Date”), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date.
(c)    With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) (1) the retiring or removed Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the Notes and (2) except for any indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and Issuing Bank directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders or the Company appoint a successor Agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Agent (other than any rights to indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Agent), and the retiring or removed Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the Notes. The fees payable by the Company to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor. After the retiring or removed Agent’s resignation or removal hereunder and under the Notes, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.04 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Agent, its sub agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or removed Agent was acting as Agent.
(d)    Any resignation pursuant to this Section by a Person acting as Agent shall, unless such Person shall notify the Company and the Lenders otherwise, also act to relieve such Person and its Affiliates of any obligation to issue new, or extend existing, Letters of Credit where such issuance or extension is to occur on or after the date that is 60 days after such Person gave notice of such resignation. Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Agent hereunder, (i) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent in its capacity (if any) as Issuing Bank, (ii) the retiring Agent in its capacity (if any) as Issuing Bank shall be discharged from all of its respective duties and obligations hereunder or under the Notes in such capacity and (iii) the successor Issuing Bank shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangement satisfactory to the retiring Issuing

SECTION 8.07. Non-Reliance on Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender and Issuing Bank acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and Issuing Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder.
SECTION 8.08. No Other Duties, etc. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Persons acting as bookrunners, arrangers, syndication agents or documentation agents listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Agent or as a Lender hereunder.
SECTION 8.09. Lender ERISA Representation. (a) Each Lender (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Agent and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of any Borrower, that at least one of the following is and will be true:
(i)    such Lender is not using “plan assets” (within the meaning of Section 3(42) of ERISA or otherwise) of one or more Benefit Plans with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments or this Agreement,

(iv)    such other representation, warranty and covenant as may be agreed in writing between the Agent, in its sole discretion, and such Lender.
(b) In addition, unless either (1) sub-clause (i) in the immediately preceding clause (a) is true with respect to a Lender or (2) a Lender has provided another representation, warranty and covenant in accordance with sub-clause (iv) in the immediately preceding clause (a), such Lender further (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Agent and not, for the avoidance

SECTION 9.03. No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of any Lender or the Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.
SECTION 9.04. Costs and Expenses. (a) The Company agrees to pay on demand all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification and amendment of this Agreement, any Notes and the other documents to be delivered hereunder, including, without limitation, (A) all due diligence, syndication (including printing, distribution and bank meetings), transportation, computer, duplication, appraisal, consultant, and audit expenses and (B) the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Agent with respect thereto and with respect to advising the Agent as to its rights and responsibilities under this Agreement.

The foregoing indemnity shall not cover or include (x) Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the Company’s obligation with respect to which is governed by Section 2.14, or Excluded Taxes, (y) increased costs, the Company’s obligation with respect to which is governed by Section 2.11 or (z) costs, charges, fees, expenses, Taxes or duties of any kind related to any hedging activities in connection with the rights or obligations of the Lenders under this Agreement.

(c)    If any payment of principal of, or Conversion of, any Eurocurrency Rate Advance is made by any Borrower to or for the account of a Lender other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance, as a result of a payment or Conversion pursuant to Section 2.08(d) or (e), 2.10 or 2.12, acceleration of the maturity of any Notes pursuant to Section 6.01 or for any other reason, or by an Eligible Assignee to a Lender other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance upon an assignment of rights and obligations under this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.07 as a result of a demand by the Company pursuant to Section 9.07(a), such Borrower shall, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender any amounts required to compensate such Lender for any additional losses, costs or expenses that it may reasonably incur as a result of such payment or Conversion, including, without limitation, any loss (excluding loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by any Lender to fund or maintain such Advance.

Each Lender severally agrees to indemnify the Agent and each Issuing Bank (in each case, to the extent not promptly reimbursed by the Company) from and against such Lender’s ratable share of any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, obligations, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, disbursements and expenses, joint or several, of any kind or nature (including the fees, charges and disbursements of any advisor or counsel for such Person) that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent or any Issuing Bank, as the case may be, in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Notes or any action taken or omitted by the Agent or any Issuing Bank under this Agreement or the Notes; provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, obligations, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, disbursements or expenses resulting from the Agent’s or such Issuing Bank’s gross negligence or willful misconduct as found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction, nor shall any Lender be liable to the extent that any claim with respect to any Special Letter of Credit under this section relates to an event arising on or after the Participation Cut-Off Date. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent and each Issuing Bank for its ratable share of any costs and expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses of counsel) payable by the Company under Section 9.04(a), to the extent that the Agent or such Issuing Bank is not promptly reimbursed for such costs and expenses by the Company.
SECTION 9.05. Right of Set‑off. Upon either (a) the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default under Section 6.01(e) or (b) (i) the occurrence and during the continuance of any other Event of Default and (ii) the making of the request or the granting of the consent specified by Section 6.01 to authorize the Agent to declare the Advances due and payable pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.01, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender or such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Company or any Borrower against any and all of the obligations of the Company or any Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement and any Note held by such Lender, whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or such Note and although such obligations may be unmatured; provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.19 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the appropriate Borrower after any such set‑off and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set‑off and application. The rights of each Lender and its Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of set‑off) that such Lender and its Affiliates may have.
SECTION 9.06. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective (other than Section 2.01, which shall only become effective upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.01) when it shall have been executed by the Company and the Agent and when the Agent shall have been notified by each Initial Lender that such Initial Lender has executed it and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company, the Agent and each Lender and their respective successors and assigns, except that neither the Company nor any other Borrower shall have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the Lenders (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void).

Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, participants to the extent provided in paragraph (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
(b)    Assignments by Lenders. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Advances at the time owing to it); provided that (in each case with respect to any Facility) any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions:
(i)    Minimum Amounts.
(A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitment and/or the Advances at the time owing to it (in each case with respect to any Facility) or in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender, no minimum amount need be assigned; and
(B) in any case not described in paragraph (b)(i)(A) of this Section, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Advances outstanding thereunder) or, if the applicable Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Advances of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Agent or, if “Trade Date” is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date) shall not be less than $10,000,000, unless each of the Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
(ii)    Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Advance or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not prohibit any Lender from assigning all or a portion of its rights and obligations among separate Facilities on a non-pro rata basis.
(iii)    Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by paragraph (b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition:
(A) the consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (x) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment, or (y) such assignment is to a Lender’s Affiliate that is a financial institution or to another Lender unless on the date of such assignment the assignee would be entitled to make a demand pursuant to Section 2.11 or 2.14 (in which case such assignment shall be permitted only if the assignee shall waive in a manner satisfactory to the Company in form and substance its rights to make such a demand); provided that the Company shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Agent within five Business Days after having received notice thereof;
(B) the consent of the Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments in respect of any assignment to a Person that is not a Lender or an Affiliate of such Lender; and

Interpublic Credit Agreement
60


(C) the consent of each Issuing Bank (such consent of each Person not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for any assignment in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility.
(iv)    Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; provided that the Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment. The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.
(v)    No Assignment to Certain Persons. No such assignment shall be made to (A) the Company or any of the Company’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries, (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Affiliates, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B), (C) any Person that was a Competitor as of the Trade Date (in which case the provisions of Section 9.07(h) shall apply), or (D) without the prior written consent of the Company, a structured finance vehicle, fund or similar entity or any similar Person in connection with a securitization.
(vi)    No Assignment to Natural Persons. No such assignment shall be made to a natural Person (or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural Person).
(vii)    Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Company and the Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Advances previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Agent, each Issuing Bank and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Advances and participations in Letters of Credit in accordance with its Ratable Share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Agent pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.11 and 9.04 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph (b) shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (d) of this Section (except in the event that such assignment or transfer was to a person that was a Competitor as of the Trade Date (in which case the provisions of Section 9.07(h) shall apply)).
(c)    Register. The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Company, shall maintain at one of its offices in the United States a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Advances owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Company, the Agent and the Lenders shall

Interpublic Credit Agreement
61


treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Company and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(d)    Participations. Each Lender may sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (other than the Company, any of the Company’s Affiliates, any natural Person, or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural Person, any Defaulting Lender, or, unless the Company’s prior consent is obtained and in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.07(h), a Competitor), in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Revolving Credit Commitment, the Advances owing to it and any Note or Notes held by it); provided, however, that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, its Revolving Credit Commitment to the Borrowers hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes of this Agreement, (iv) the Company, the other Borrowers, the Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement and (v) no participant under any such participation shall have any rights as a Lender hereunder, including, without limitation, any right to make any demand under Section 2.11 or 2.14 or right to approve any amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any Note, or any consent to any departure by the Company or any other Borrower therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment, waiver or consent would reduce the principal of, or interest on, any Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such participation, or postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, any Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or reduce or limit the obligations of the Company under Section 7.01 or release or otherwise limit the Company’s liability with respect to its obligations under Article VII or amend this Section 9.07(d) in any manner adverse to such participant, in each case to the extent subject to such participation and in any event such voting rights shall not exceed those of the Lender hereunder that is the seller of such participation.
(e)    Participant Register. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a nonfiduciary agent of the Company, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each participant’s interest in the Advances or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any participant or any information relating to a participant's interest in any commitments, Advances, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Agent (in its capacity as Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
(f)    Disclosure to Assignee or Participant. Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation permitted under this Section 9.07, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant other than, unless the Company’s prior consent is obtained, a Competitor, any information relating to any Borrower furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of such Borrower; provided that, prior to any such disclosure, the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant shall agree for the benefit of the Company to preserve the confidentiality of any Information relating to any Borrower received by it from such Lender.
(g)    Certain Security Interests. Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement, any Lender may at any time create a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Advances owing to it and any Note or Notes held by it) in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or any central bank in accordance with applicable law or regulation; provided that no such creation of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute such secured party for such Lender as a party hereto.

Interpublic Credit Agreement
62


(h)    No Assignment or Participations to Competitors. No assignment or participation shall be made or sold, as applicable, to any Person that was a Competitor as of the date (the “Determination Date”) on which the assigning or selling Lender entered into a binding agreement to sell all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to such Person or assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to such Person (unless the Company has consented to such assignment or participation in writing in its sole and absolute discretion, in which case such Person will not be considered a Competitor for the purpose of such assignment or participation). For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any assignee or participant that becomes a Competitor after the applicable Determination Date (including as a result of the delivery of a notice pursuant to, and/or the expiration of the notice period referred to in, the definition of “Competitor”), (x) such assignee or participant shall not retroactively be disqualified from becoming a Lender or participant and (y) the execution by the Company of an Assignment and Assumption with respect to an assignee will not by itself result in such assignee no longer being considered a Competitor. Any assignment or participation in violation of this Section 9.07(h) shall not be void, but the other provisions of this Section 9.07(h) shall apply. If any assignment is made or any participation is sold to any Competitor without the Company’s prior written consent, or if any Person becomes a Competitor after the applicable Determination Date, the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to the applicable Competitor and the Agent, (A) terminate any Commitment of such Competitor and/or repay all obligations of the Borrowers owing to such Competitor in connection with such Commitment and/or (B) require such Competitor to assign, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in this Section 9.07), all of its interest, rights and obligations under this Agreement (including as a participant) to one or more Eligible Assignees at the lesser of (x) the principal amount thereof and (y) the amount that such Competitor paid to acquire such interests, rights and obligations, in each case plus accrued interest, accrued fees and all other amounts (other than principal amounts) payable to it hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Competitors (A) will not (x) have the right to receive information, reports or other materials provided to Lenders by the Borrowers, the Agent or any other Lender, (y) attend or participate in meetings attended by the Lenders and the Agent, or (z) access any electronic site established for the Lenders or confidential communications from counsel to or financial advisors of the Agent or the Lenders and (B) (x) for purposes of any consent to any amendment, waiver or modification of, or any action under, and for the purpose of any direction to the Agent or any Lender to undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action) under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, each Competitor will be deemed to have consented in the same proportion as the Lenders that are not Competitors consented to such matter, and (y) for purposes of voting on any plan of reorganization or plan of liquidation pursuant to any debtor relief laws (a “Plan”), each Competitor party hereto hereby agrees (1) not to vote on such Plan, (2) if such Competitor does vote on such Plan notwithstanding the restriction in the foregoing sentence, such vote will be deemed not to be in good faith and shall be “designated” pursuant to Section 1126(e) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision in any other debtor relief laws), and such vote shall not be counted in determining whether the applicable class has accepted or rejected such Plan in accordance with Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision in any other debtor relief laws) and (3) not to contest any request by any party for a determination by the Bankruptcy Court (or other applicable court of competent jurisdiction) effectuating the foregoing sentence. The Agent shall have the right, and the Company hereby expressly authorizes the Agent, to (A) post the list of Competitors provided by the Company and any updates thereto from time to time (collectively, the “Competitor List”) on the Platform, including that portion of the Platform that is designated for “public side” Lenders and/or (B) provide the Competitor List to each Lender requesting the same. The Agent shall not (x) be obligated to ascertain, monitor or inquire as to whether any Lender or participant is a Competitor or (y) have any liability with respect to any assignment or sale of a participation to a Competitor.
SECTION 9.08. Confidentiality. Each of the Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Bank agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates’ respective managers, partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and other representatives who need to know the Information in connection with this Agreement or in connection with other contemplated transactions for the benefit of the Company (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential on substantially the same terms as provided herein), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority having jurisdiction over it (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and including in connection with any pledge made in accordance with Section 9.07(g)), (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) to the extent necessary in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any Note or any action

Interpublic Credit Agreement
63


or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any Note or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement for the benefit of the Company containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section (i) to any assignee, participant or prospective assignee or participant, in each case permitted hereunder or (ii) to any credit insurance provider or to any actual or prospective counterparty to any swap, derivative or other similar transaction, in each case under which payments are to be made by reference to the Company and its obligations, entered into by a Lender in connection with this Agreement, (g) with the consent of the Company, (h) on a confidential basis to the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar agency in connection with the issuance and monitoring of CUSIP numbers with respect to the Facilities or (i) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (y) becomes available to the Agent, any Lender, the Issuing Bank or their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Company that, to the knowledge of the Agent, such Lender, the Issuing Bank or such Affiliate, as applicable, is not in violation of any confidentiality agreement with the Company. In addition, the Agent and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this Agreement and information about the terms of this Agreement to market data collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry and service providers to the Agent and the Lenders in connection with the administration of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and the Commitments.
For purposes of this Section, “Information” means all confidential, proprietary or non-public information of the Company furnished to the Agent or the Lenders by the Company.
SECTION 9.09. Designated Subsidiaries. (a) Designation. The Company may at any time, and from time to time, upon not less than 15 Business Days’ notice in the case of any Subsidiary so designated after the Restatement Date, notify the Agent that the Company intends to designate a Subsidiary as a “Designated Subsidiary” for purposes of this Agreement. On or after the date that is 15 Business Days after such notice, upon delivery to the Agent and each Lender of a Designation Agreement duly executed by the Company and the respective Subsidiary and substantially in the form of Exhibit E hereto, such Subsidiary shall thereupon become a “Designated Subsidiary” for purposes of this Agreement and, as such, shall have all of the rights and obligations of a Borrower hereunder. The Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Company’s notice of such pending designation by the Company and the identity of the respective Subsidiary. Following the giving of any notice pursuant to this Section 9.09(a), if the designation of such Designated Subsidiary obligates the Agent or any Lender to comply with “know your customer” or similar identification procedures in circumstances where the necessary information is not already available to it, the Company shall, promptly upon the request of the Agent or any Lender, supply such documentation and other evidence as is reasonably requested by the Agent or any Lender in order for the Agent or such Lender to carry out and be satisfied it has complied with the results of all necessary “know your customer” or other similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations.
If the Company shall designate as a Designated Subsidiary hereunder any Subsidiary not organized under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, any Lender may, with notice to the Agent and the Company, fulfill its Revolving Credit Commitment by causing an Affiliate of such Lender to act as the Lender in respect of such Designated Subsidiary.
As soon as practicable after receiving notice from the Company or the Agent of the Company’s intent to designate a Subsidiary as a Designated Subsidiary, and in any event no later than five Business Days after the delivery of such notice, for a Designated Subsidiary that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than of the United States or a political subdivision thereof, any Lender that may not legally lend to, establish credit for the account of and/or do any business whatsoever with such Designated Subsidiary, either directly or through an Affiliate of such Lender selected pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph, or whose internal policies prohibit lending to or establishing credit for entities organized under the laws of such jurisdiction (a “Protesting Lender”) shall so notify the Company and the Agent in writing. With respect to each Protesting Lender, the Company shall, effective on or before the date that such Designated Subsidiary shall have the right to borrow hereunder, either (A) notify the Agent and such Protesting Lender that the Revolving Credit Commitments of such Protesting Lender shall be terminated; provided that such Protesting Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Advances and/or Letter of Credit reimbursement obligations, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts then payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the

Interpublic Credit Agreement
64


Company or the relevant Designated Subsidiary (in the case of all other amounts), or (B) cancel its request to designate such Subsidiary as a “Designated Subsidiary” hereunder.
(b)    Termination. Upon the payment and performance in full of all of the indebtedness, liabilities and obligations under this Agreement and the Notes of any Designated Subsidiary then, so long as at the time no Notice of Borrowing in respect of such Designated Subsidiary is outstanding, such Subsidiary’s status as a “Designated Subsidiary” shall terminate upon notice to such effect from the Agent to the Lenders (which notice the Agent shall give promptly upon its receipt of a request therefor from the Company). Thereafter, the Lenders shall be under no further obligation to make any Advance hereunder to such Designated Subsidiary.
SECTION 9.10. Governing Law. This Agreement and the Notes shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to conflicts of law provisions that might require application of the laws of a different jurisdiction.
SECTION 9.11. Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by electronic medium or facsimile shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
SECTION 9.12. Judgment. (a) If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in Dollars into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Agent could purchase Dollars with such other currency at Citibank’s principal office in London at 11:00 A.M. (London time) on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given.
(b)    If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in a Committed Currency or Committed L/C Currency into Dollars, the parties agree to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Agent could purchase such Committed Currency or Committed L/C Currency with Dollars at Citibank’s principal office in London at 11:00 A.M. (London time) on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given.
(c)    The obligation of the Company and each other Borrower in respect of any sum due from it in any currency (the “Primary Currency”) to any Lender or the Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in any other currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be), of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency, such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the applicable Primary Currency with such other currency; if the amount of the applicable Primary Currency so purchased is less than such sum due to such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) in the applicable Primary Currency, the Company and each other Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) against such loss, and if the amount of the applicable Primary Currency so purchased exceeds such sum due to any Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) in the applicable Primary Currency, such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) agrees to remit to the Company or such other Borrower such excess.

SECTION 9.13. Jurisdiction, Etc. (a) Each of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that it will not commence any action, litigation or proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any party hereto or any Related Party of the foregoing in any way relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions relating hereto or thereto, in any forum other than the courts of the State of New York sitting in New York County, and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, and each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the jurisdiction of such courts and agrees that all claims in respect of any such action, litigation or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State court or, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in such federal court. The Company and each other Borrower hereby further irrevocably consent to the service of process in any action or proceeding in such courts by the mailing thereof by any parties hereto by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the Company at its address specified pursuant to Section 9.02. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action, litigation or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.
(b)    Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any Notes in any New York State or federal court. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.
SECTION 9.14. Substitution of Currency. If a change in any Committed Currency or Committed L/C Currency occurs pursuant to any applicable law, rule or regulation of any governmental, monetary or multi-national authority, this Agreement (including, without limitation, the definitions of Eurocurrency Rate) will be amended to the extent determined by the Agent (acting reasonably and in consultation with the Company) to be necessary to reflect the change in currency and to put the Lenders and the Company in the same position, so far as possible, that they would have been in if no change in such Committed Currency or Committed L/C Currency had occurred.
SECTION 9.15. No Liability Regarding Letters of Credit. None of the Agent, the Lenders nor any Issuing Bank, nor any of their Affiliates, or the respective directors, officers, employees, agents and advisors of such Person or such Affiliate, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder, or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the applicable Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any Issuing Bank from liability to the applicable Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrowers to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by such Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Bank’s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof or any failure to honor a Letter of Credit where such Issuing Bank is, under applicable law, required to honor it. The parties hereto expressly agree that, as long as the Issuing Bank has not acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct, such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, an Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.

66


SECTION 9.16. Patriot Act Notification. Each Lender and the Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Company and each other Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Borrower, which information includes the name and address of each Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender or the Agent, as applicable, to identify each Borrower in accordance with the Patriot Act. Each Borrower shall provide, to the extent commercially reasonable, such information and take such actions as are reasonably requested by the Agent or any Lenders in order to assist the Agent and the Lenders in maintaining compliance with the Patriot Act.
SECTION 9.17. No Fiduciary Duty. The Agent, each Lender and their Affiliates (collectively, solely for purposes of this paragraph, the “Lenders”) may have economic interests that conflict with those of the Borrowers. The Borrowers agree that nothing in the Loan Documents will be deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty between the Lenders and any Borrower, its stockholders or its affiliates. Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that (i) the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents are arm’s-length commercial transactions between the Lenders, on the one hand, and such Borrower, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each of the Lenders is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of such Borrower, its management, stockholders, creditors or any other person, (iii) no Lender has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of such Borrower with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether any Lender or any of its affiliates has advised or is currently advising such Borrower on other matters) or any other obligation to such Borrower except the obligations expressly set forth in the Loan Documents and (iv) such Borrower has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. Each Borrower further acknowledges and agrees that it is responsible for making its own independent judgment with respect to such transactions and the process leading thereto. Each Borrower agrees that it will not claim that any Lender has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to such Borrower, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
SECTION 9.18. Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Certain Financial Institutions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges and accepts that any liability of any Lender under or in connection with this Agreement may be subject to Bail-In Action by the relevant Resolution Authority and acknowledges and accepts to be bound by the effect of:
(a)    the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by a Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any Lender party hereto that is subject to the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of any Resolution Authority; and
(b)    the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:
(i)    a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;
(ii)    a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement; or
(iii)    the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of any Resolution Authority.
SECTION 9.19. Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the Company, each other Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, all right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any Notes or the actions of the Agent or any Lender in the negotiation, administration, performance or enforcement thereof.

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, [THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC., a Delaware corporation][Name of Designated Subsidiary] (the “Borrower”), HEREBY PROMISES TO PAY to ________________________ (the “Lender”) or its registered assigns for the account of its Applicable Lending Office on the Termination Date applicable to the Lender (each as defined in the Credit Agreement referred to below) the principal sum of U.S.$[amount of the Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment in figures] or, if less, the aggregate principal amount of the Advances made by the Lender to the Borrower pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of November 1, 2019 among The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., the Lender and certain other lenders parties thereto and Citibank, N.A., as Agent for the Lender and such other lenders (as amended or modified from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”; the terms defined therein being used herein as therein defined) outstanding on such date.

EXHIBIT D-2 - FORM OF
OPINION OF IN-HOUSE
COUNSEL OF THE
COMPANY

[Restatement Date]
To each of the Lenders parties
to the Credit Agreement (as defined below),
among The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.,
said Lenders and Citibank, N.A.,
as Agent for said Lenders, and
to Citibank, N.A., as Agent
Credit Agreement

Ladies and Gentlemen:
This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 3.01(d)(iv) of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of November 1, 2019 (the “Credit Agreement”), among The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (the “Company”), the Lenders parties thereto and Citibank, N.A., as Agent for said Lenders. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined.
I have acted as General Counsel for the Company in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement.
In arriving at the opinions expressed below, I have examined the following documents:
(1)    An executed copy of the Credit Agreement.
(2)    The documents furnished by the Company pursuant to Article III of the Credit Agreement.
(3)    A copy of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company and all amendments thereto (the “Charter”).
(4)    A copy of the by‑laws of the Company and all amendments thereto (the “By‑laws”).
(5)    A certificate of the Secretary of State of Delaware, dated __________, 2019, attesting to the continued corporate existence and good standing of the Company in that State.
In addition, I have examined the originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such other corporate records of the Company, certificates of public officials and of officers of the Company and such other persons as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions expressed below.
In rendering the opinions expressed below, I have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to me as copies. In addition, I have assumed and have not verified the accuracy as to factual matters of each document I have reviewed (including, without limitation, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company in the Credit Agreement).
Based upon the foregoing and subject to the further assumptions and qualifications set forth below, it is my opinion that:


1.    The Company is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
2.    The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement and the Notes to be delivered by it, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, are within the Company’s corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not contravene (i) the Charter or the By‑laws or (ii) any material contractual or legal restriction known to me contained in any material document to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound. The Credit Agreement and the Notes have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Company.
3.    To the best of my knowledge, no authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any third party is required for the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement and the Notes.
4.    To the best of my knowledge, there are no pending or overtly threatened actions or proceedings against the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator that purport to affect the validity, binding effect or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any of the Notes or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby or, except as disclosed in the Company’s reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission prior to the Restatement Date, that are likely to have a materially adverse effect upon the financial condition or operations of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
With regard to clause (ii) of paragraph 2 above, I express no opinion as to whether the deposit of cash into the L/C Cash Deposit Account would be permissible under the applicable lien covenants (all of which permit the Company to create liens in an amount based on its consolidated net worth) at the time such cash is provided.
The foregoing opinions are limited to the law of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the Federal law of the United States.
I am furnishing this opinion letter to you solely for your benefit in connection with the Credit Agreement. This opinion letter is not to be used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a copy of this opinion letter may be furnished to, and relied upon by, your successors and a permitted transferee who becomes a party to the Credit Agreement as a Lender thereunder, and you or any such successor or transferee may show this opinion to any governmental authority pursuant to requirements of applicable law or regulations. The opinions expressed herein are, however, rendered on and as of the date hereof, and I assume no obligation to advise you or any such transferee or governmental authority or any other person, or to make any investigations, as to any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof that might affect the opinions expressed herein.
Very truly yours,
_____________________________________
