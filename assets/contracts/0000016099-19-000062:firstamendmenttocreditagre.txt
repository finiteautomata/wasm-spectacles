To the extent of conflict between the terms of this Agreement, the Amended Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the terms of this Agreement shall govern and control.

(b)Costs and Expenses. The Borrower acknowledges that Section 12.3(a) of the Amended Credit Agreement applies to this Agreement and the transactions, agreements and documents contemplated hereunder.

(g)Relationship.

Each Credit Party further acknowledges that the Administrative Agent and each Lender has not taken or failed to take any action under or in connection with its respective rights under the Credit Agreement and the Loan Documents that in any way or to any extent has interfered with or adversely affects any ownership of Collateral by each Credit Party.

(h)Acknowledgement and Reaffirmation. Except as expressly set forth herein, (i) this Agreement shall not by implication or otherwise limit, impair, constitute a waiver of or otherwise affect the rights and remedies of the Lenders or the Administrative Agent, in each case under the Amended Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, and (ii) shall not alter, modify, amend or in any way affect any of the terms, conditions, obligations, covenants or agreements contained in the Amended Credit Agreement or any other provision of either such agreement or any other Loan Document. Except as expressly set forth herein, each and every term, condition, obligation, covenant and agreement contained in the Amended Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document is hereby ratified and re‑affirmed in all respects and shall continue in full force and effect. Each Credit Party hereby expressly (a) acknowledges the terms of this Agreement, (b) ratifies and reaffirms all of their respective Obligations and each of their other obligations under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, as modified hereby, (c) acknowledges, renews and extends its continued liability under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, as modified hereby, (d) ratifies and reaffirms all Liens granted by it pursuant to the Loan Documents to secure the Obligations and (e) reaffirms that its guarantee under each Guaranty Agreement, if applicable, and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party remains in full force and effect with respect to the Obligations. This Agreement shall constitute a Loan Document for purposes of the Amended Credit Agreement and from and after the First Amendment Effective Date, all references to the "Credit Agreement" in any Loan Document and all references in the Amended Credit Agreement to "this Agreement", "hereunder", "hereof" or words of like import referring to the Credit Agreement, shall, unless expressly provided otherwise, refer to the Amended Credit Agreement. Each Credit Party hereby consents to this Agreement and confirms that all obligations of each Credit Party under the Loan Documents to which such Credit Party is a party shall continue to apply to the Amended Credit Agreement.





(i)No Action, Claims, Etc. As of the date hereof, each Credit Party hereby acknowledges and confirms that it has no knowledge of any actions, causes of action, claims, demands, damages and liabilities of whatever kind or nature, in law or in equity, against the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, or any of the Administrative Agent’s or any Lender’s respective officers, employees, representatives, agents, counsel or directors arising from any action by such Persons, or failure of such Persons to act under the Credit Agreement prior to the date hereof.

(j)Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, but all of such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same agreement. Receipt by telecopy, facsimile or email transmission of any executed signature page to this Agreement shall constitute effective delivery of such signature page.

(k)Interpretation. Wherever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

(l)Headings. The headings of this Agreement are for purposes of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof.

(m)Entirety. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents embody the entire agreement between the parties and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, if any, relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents represent the final agreement between the parties and may not be contradicted by evidence of prior, contemporaneous or subsequent oral agreements of the parties.

(n)GOVERNING LAW, JURISDICTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS REGARDING GOVERNING LAW, JURISDICTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER SET FORTH IN SECTIONS 12.5 and 12.6 OF THE AMENDED CREDIT AGREEMENT, AND SUCH PROVISIONS ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY THIS REFERENCE, MUTATIS MUTANDIS.
