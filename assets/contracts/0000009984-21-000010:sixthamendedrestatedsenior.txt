effect from the date on which such member state adopts the Euro as its lawful currency; provided that if any Loan made in the currency of such member state is outstanding immediately prior to such date, such replacement shall take effect, with respect to such Loan, at the end of the then current Interest Period.

Unless a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, BGI may request, with prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, and subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent if with respect to a new lender, that the Total Commitment be increased, provided that the Total Commitment shall not, except with the consent of the Required Lenders, in any event exceed $1,250,000,000 hereunder, and provided, further, that (i) any Lender which is a party to this Revolving Credit Agreement prior to such increase shall have the first option to increase its Commitment hereunder, but no Lender shall have any obligation to do so, (ii) in the event that it becomes necessary to include a new Lender to provide additional funding under this §2.3.1, such new Lender must be reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and BGI, (iii) the Lenders’ Commitment Percentages shall be correspondingly adjusted, as necessary, to reflect any increase in the Total Commitment and Schedule 1 shall be amended to reflect such adjustments and (iv) BGI may make a maximum of two such requests. Each increase in the Total Commitment shall be in a minimum aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.
2.4    Evidence of Debt.
(a)    The Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative
39





Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Loans made by the Lenders to the Borrowers and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrowers hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender to BGI, Barnes Germany, Barnes Luxembourg and/or Barnes Switzerland, as the case may be, made through the Administrative Agent, BGI, Barnes Germany, Barnes Luxembourg and/or Barnes Switzerland, as the case may be, shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender’s Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount, currency and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.
(b)    In addition to the accounts and records referred to in subsection (a) above, each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.
2.5    Interest on Loans. Except as otherwise provided in §5.10,
(a)    Each Loan which is a Base Rate Loan shall bear interest for the period commencing with the Drawdown Date thereof and ending on the last day of the Interest Period with respect thereto at the rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin with respect to Base Rate Loans as in effect from time to time.
(b)    Each Loan which is a Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall bear interest for the period commencing with the Drawdown Date thereof and ending on the last day of the Interest Period with respect thereto at the rate per annum equal to the Eurocurrency Rate determined for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin with respect to Eurocurrency Rate Loans as in effect from time to time.
(c)    Each Loan which is an Overnight Rate Loan shall bear interest for the period commencing with the Drawdown Date thereof and ending on the date that such Overnight Rate Loan is repaid or refinanced at the rate per annum equal to the Overnight Rate plus the Applicable Margin with respect to Overnight Rate Loans as in effect from time to time.
(d)    Barnes Germany, Barnes Luxembourg and Barnes Switzerland shall only be permitted to borrow Loans which bear interest at the Eurocurrency Rate.
40

2.6    Requests for Loans.
2.6.1.    General. BGI, Barnes Germany, Barnes Luxembourg and/or Barnes Switzerland, as the case may be, shall give to the Administrative Agent written notice in the form of Exhibit B-1 hereto (or such other form as may be approved by the Administrative Agent, including any form on an electronic platform or electronic transmission system as shall be approved by the Administrative Agent or telephonic notice confirmed in a writing in the form of Exhibit B-1 hereto or such other form approved by the Administrative Agent) of each Loan requested hereunder (a “Loan Request”) no later than (a) 11:00 a.m. (Eastern time) on the proposed Drawdown Date of any Base Rate Loan, (b) 11:00 a.m. (Eastern time) three (3) Eurocurrency Business Days prior to the proposed Drawdown Date of any Eurocurrency Rate Loan denominated in Dollars requested by BGI, (c) 11:00 a.m. (Eastern time) four (4) Eurocurrency Business Days (or five (5) Business Days in the case of Special Notice Currency) prior to the proposed Drawdown Date of any Eurocurrency Rate Loan denominated in Alternative Currencies requested by any Borrower or in Dollars requested by any of Barnes Germany, Barnes Luxembourg or Barnes Switzerland. Each such notice shall specify (i) the principal amount of the Loan requested, (ii) the proposed Drawdown Date of such Loan, (iii) the Interest Period for such Loan, (iv) the Type of such Loan, and (v) the currency of such Loan to be borrowed. If such Borrower fails to specify a currency in a Loan Request, then the Loan so requested shall be made in Dollars. Promptly upon receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall notify each of the Lenders thereof. Each Loan Request shall be irrevocable and binding on BGI, Barnes Germany, Barnes Luxembourg and/or Barnes Switzerland, as the case may be, and shall obligate such Borrower to accept the Loan requested from the Lenders on the proposed Drawdown Date. Each Loan Request shall be in a minimum aggregate amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof, and after giving effect to all Loans, all conversions of Loans from one Type to another as provided in §2.7.1, and all continuations of Loans as the same Type as provided in §2.7.2, there shall not be more than ten (10) Interest Periods in effect with respect to the Loans.
2.7    Conversion Options.
2.7.1.    Conversion to Different Type of Loan. The applicable Borrower may elect from time to time to convert any outstanding Loan to a Loan of another Type, provided that (a) with respect to any such conversion of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan denominated in Dollars to a Base Rate Loan, the applicable Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent written notice (including notice given via an electronic platform or electronic transmission system approved by the Administrative Agent) no later than 11:00
41





a.m. (Eastern time) at least three (3) Eurocurrency Business Days prior to such election; (b) with respect to any such conversion of a Base Rate Loan to a Eurocurrency Rate Loan denominated in Dollars, the applicable Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent written notice (including notice given via an electronic platform or electronic transmission system approved by the Administrative Agent) no later than 11:00 a.m. (Eastern time) at least three (3) Eurocurrency Business Days prior to such election; (c) with respect to any such conversion of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan denominated in Alternative Currencies, the applicable Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent written notice (including notice given via an electronic platform or electronic transmission system approved by the Administrative Agent) no later than 11:00 a.m. (Eastern time) at least four (4) Eurocurrency Business Days (or five (5) Eurocurrency Business Days in the case of a Special Notice Currency) prior to such election; (d) with respect to any such conversion of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan into a Base Rate Loan, such conversion shall only be made on the last day of the Interest Period with respect thereto and (e) no Loan may be converted into a Eurocurrency Rate Loan when any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. On the date on which such conversion is being made each Lender shall take such action as is necessary to transfer its Commitment Percentage of such Loans to its Domestic Lending Office or its Eurocurrency Lending Office, as the case may be. All or any part of outstanding Loans of any Type may be converted into a Loan of another Type as provided herein, provided that any partial conversion shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. Each Conversion Request relating to the conversion of a Loan to a Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall be irrevocable by the Borrowers. No Loan may be converted into a Loan denominated in a different currency, but instead must be prepaid in the original currency of such Loan and reborrowed in the other currency.
2.7.2.    Continuation of Type of Loan. Any Loan of any Type may be continued as a Loan of the same Type upon the expiration of an Interest Period with respect thereto by compliance by the applicable Borrower with the notice provisions contained in §2.7.1; provided that no Eurocurrency Rate Loan may be continued as such when any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, but shall be automatically converted to a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the first Interest Period relating thereto ending during the continuance of any Default or Event of Default of which officers of the Administrative Agent active upon the Borrowers’ account have actual knowledge. In the event that the applicable Borrower fails to provide any such notice with respect to the continuation of any Eurocurrency Rate Loan as such, then such Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall be automatically converted to a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the first Interest Period relating thereto. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders promptly when any such automatic conversion contemplated by this §2.7 is scheduled to occur. No Loan may be continued as a Loan denominated in a different currency, but instead must be prepaid in the original currency of such Loan and reborrowed in the other currency.
2.7.3.    Eurocurrency Rate Loans. Any conversion to or from Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that,
42





after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of all Eurocurrency Rate Loans having the same Interest Period shall not be less than $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.
2.8    Funds for Loan.
2.8.1.    Funding Procedures. Not later than 2:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the proposed Drawdown Date of any Loans denominated in Dollars and not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of any Loans in an Alternative Currency, each of the Lenders will make available to the Administrative Agent, at the Administrative Agent’s Office, in Same Day Funds, the amount of such Lender’s Commitment Percentage of the amount of the requested Loans for the applicable currency. Upon receipt from each Lender of such amount, and upon receipt of the documents required by §§11 and 12 and the satisfaction of the other conditions set forth therein, to the extent applicable, the Administrative Agent will make available to BGI, Barnes Germany, Barnes Luxembourg and/or Barnes Switzerland, as the case may be, the aggregate amount of such Loans made available to the Administrative Agent by the Lenders. The failure or refusal of any Lender to make available to the Administrative Agent at the aforesaid time and place on any Drawdown Date the amount of its Commitment Percentage of the requested Loans shall not relieve any other Lender from its several obligation hereunder to make available to the Administrative Agent the amount of such other Lender’s Commitment Percentage of any requested Loans.
2.8.2.    Advances by Administrative Agent. (a) The Administrative Agent may, unless notified to the contrary by any Lender prior to a Drawdown Date or the Applicable Time, as the case may be, assume that such Lender has made available to the Administrative Agent on such Drawdown Date or Applicable Time, as the case may be, the amount of such Lender’s Commitment Percentage of the Loans to be made on such Drawdown Date or Applicable Time, as the case may be, and the Administrative Agent may (but it shall not be required to), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to BGI, Barnes Germany, Barnes Luxembourg and/or Barnes Switzerland, as the case may be, a corresponding amount. If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent such amount on a date after such Drawdown Date or Applicable Time, as the case may be, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Commitment Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is paid by such Lender, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing. If the amount of such Lender’s Commitment Percentage of such Loans is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three (3) Business Days following such Drawdown Date or Applicable Time, as the case may be, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such
43





amount from the applicable Borrower on demand, with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to the Loans made on such Drawdown Date or Applicable Time, as the case may be. The obligations of any Lender under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Credit Agreement.
(b)    The Administrative Agent may, unless notified to the contrary by BGI, Barnes Germany, Barnes Luxembourg and/or Barnes Switzerland, as the case may be, prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank hereunder, as applicable, that the applicable Borrower will not make such payment, assume that the applicable Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the applicable Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing.
(c)    A statement of the Administrative Agent submitted to a Lender with respect to any amounts owing under clause (a) or (b) above shall be prima facie evidence of the amount due and owing to the Administrative Agent by such Lender.
2.9    Swing Line Loans.
2.9.1.    The Swing Line.
(a)    Domestic Swing Line. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swing Line Lender, in reliance upon the agreements of the other Lenders set forth in this §2.9, may, in its sole discretion, make loans in Dollars (each such loan, a “Domestic Swing Line Loan”) to BGI from time to time on any Business Day in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of the Domestic Swing Line Sublimit, notwithstanding the fact that such Domestic Swing Line Loans, when aggregated with the Commitment Percentage of the outstanding amount of Loans, Foreign Swing Line Loans and Letter of Credit Obligations of the Swing Line Lender, may exceed the amount of such Lender’s Commitment; provided, however, that after giving effect to any Domestic Swing Line Loan, (i) the total amount of Loans plus the Maximum Drawing Amount and any Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations outstanding shall not exceed the Total Commitments, and (ii) the aggregate outstanding amount of the Loans of any Lender (other than the Swing Line Lender), plus such Lender’s Commitment Percentage of the outstanding amount of all Letter of Credit Obligations, plus such Lender’s Commitment Percentage of the outstanding amount of all Swing Line Loans shall not exceed such Lender’s Commitment, and provided, further, that the
44





Borrowers shall not use the proceeds of any Domestic Swing Line Loan to refinance any outstanding Swing Line Loan.
(b)    Foreign Swing Line. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swing Line Lender, in reliance upon the agreements of the other Lenders set forth in this §2.9, may, in its sole discretion, make loans in one or more Alternative Currencies or Dollars (each such loan, a “Foreign Swing Line Loan” and collectively with the Domestic Swing Line Loans, “Swing Line Loans”) to Barnes Germany, Barnes Luxembourg and/or Barnes Switzerland from time to time on any Business Day in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of the Foreign Swing Line Sublimit, notwithstanding the fact that such Foreign Swing Line Loans, when aggregated with the Commitment Percentage of the outstanding amount of Loans, Domestic Swing Line Loans and Letter of Credit Obligations of the Swing Line Lender, may exceed the amount of such Lender’s Commitment; provided, however, that after giving effect to any Foreign Swing Line Loan, (i) the total amount of Loans plus the Maximum Drawing Amount and any Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations outstanding shall not exceed the Total Commitments, and (ii) the aggregate outstanding amount of the Loans of any Lender (other than the Swing Line Lender), plus such Lender’s Commitment Percentage of the outstanding amount of all Letter of Credit Obligations, plus such Lender’s Commitment Percentage of the outstanding amount of all Swing Line Loans shall not exceed such Lender’s Commitment, and provided, further, that the Borrowers shall not use the proceeds of any Foreign Swing Line Loan to refinance any outstanding Swing Line Loan.
(c)    Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrowers may borrow under this §2.9, prepay under §3.3, and reborrow under this §2.9. Each Domestic Swing Line Loan borrowed by BGI shall be a Base Rate Loan. Each Foreign Swing Line Loan borrowed by Barnes Germany, Barnes Luxembourg and/or Barnes Switzerland shall be an Overnight Rate Loan. Immediately upon the making of a Swing Line Loan, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swing Line Lender a risk participation in such Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to the product of such Lender’s Commitment Percentage times the amount of such Swing Line Loan.
2.9.2.    Borrowing Procedures. Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made upon BGI’s irrevocable notice to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone. Each such notice must be received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the proposed Drawdown Date, or in the case of a Foreign Swing Line Loan, (x) not later than 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the proposed Drawdown Date for any Foreign Swing Line Borrowing requested in Euros or Sterling and (y) not later than 3:00 p.m. (London time) one (1) Eurocurrency Business Day prior to the proposed Drawdown Date for any Foreign Swing Line Borrowing requested in Swiss Francs or Dollars, and in the case of all Swing Line Borrowings, each such notice shall specify (i) the amount to be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of $100,000, and (ii) the requested borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day. Each such telephonic notice must be confirmed promptly by
45





delivery to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent of a written Swing Line Loan Request, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of BGI, Barnes Germany, Barnes Luxembourg and/or Barnes Switzerland, as the case may be. Promptly after receipt by the Swing Line Lender of any telephonic Swing Line Loan Request, the Swing Line Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has also received such Swing Line Loan Request and, if not, the Swing Line Lender will notify the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof. Unless the Swing Line Lender has received notice (by telephone or in writing) from the Administrative Agent (including at the request of any Lender) prior to 2:00 p.m. on the date of the proposed Swing Line Borrowing (A) directing the Swing Line Lender not to make such Swing Line Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the first proviso to the first sentence of either §2.9.1(a) or (b), as applicable, or (B) that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in §11 or §12 is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swing Line Lender will, not later than 3:00 p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such Swing Line Loan Request, make the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to the applicable Borrower at its office by crediting the account of such Borrower on the books of the Swing Line Lender in immediately available funds.
2.9.3.    Refinancing of Swing Line Loans.
(a)    The Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole discretion may request, on behalf of each Borrower (which hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swing Line Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Lender make a Base Rate Loan or Overnight Rate Loan, as applicable, in an amount equal to such Lender’s Commitment Percentage of the amount of Swing Line Loans then outstanding. Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Loan Request for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of §2.6, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans or Overnight Rate Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of the Total Commitments and the conditions set forth in §12. The Swing Line Lender shall furnish BGI with a copy of the applicable Loan Request promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Lender shall make an amount equal to its Commitment Percentage of the amount specified in such Loan Request available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral available with respect to the applicable Swing Line Loan) for the account of the Swing Line Lender at the Administrative Agent’s Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day specified in such Loan Request, whereupon, subject to §2.9.3(b), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan or Overnight Rate Loan, as applicable, to the applicable Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swing Line Lender.
(b)    If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Borrowing in accordance with §2.9.3(a), the request for Base Rate Loans or Overnight Rate Loans, as the case may be, submitted by the Swing Line Lender as set forth herein
46





shall be deemed to be a request by the Swing Line Lender that each of the Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan and each Lender’s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender pursuant to §2.9.3(a) shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation.
(c)    If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this §2.9 by the time specified in §2.9.3(a), the Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Swing Line Lender in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Swing Line Lender in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in the relevant Borrowing or funded participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan, as the case may be. A certificate of the Swing Line Lender submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (c) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d)    Each Lender’s obligation to make Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans pursuant to this §2.9.3 shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Swing Line Lender, any Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Lender’s obligation to make Loans pursuant to this §2.9.3 is subject to the conditions set forth in §12. No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of each Borrower to repay Swing Line Loans, together with interest as provided herein.
2.9.4.    Repayment of Participations.
(a)    At any time after any Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swing Line Loan, if the Swing Line Lender receives any payment on account of such Swing Line Loan, the Swing Line Lender will distribute to such Lender its Commitment Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by the Swing Line Lender.
(b)    If any payment received by the Swing Line Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to be returned by the Swing Line Lender under any of the circumstances described in §16.1 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swing Line Lender in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Swing Line Lender its Commitment Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative
47





Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of the Swing Line Lender. The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Credit Agreement.
2.9.5.    Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender. The Swing Line Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the Borrowers for interest on the Swing Line Loans. Until each Lender funds its Base Rate Loan, Overnight Rate Loan or risk participation pursuant to this §2.9 to refinance such Lender’s Commitment Percentage of any Swing Line Loan, interest in respect of such Commitment Percentage shall be solely for the account of the Swing Line Lender.
2.9.6.    Payments Directly to Swing Line Lender. The Borrowers shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swing Line Loans directly to the Swing Line Lender.
3.    REPAYMENT OF THE LOANS.

3.1    Maturity. BGI promises to pay and, solely in the case of the Barnes Germany Loans, Barnes Germany promises to pay and, solely in the case of the Barnes Luxembourg Loans, Barnes Luxembourg promises to pay and, solely in the case of the Barnes Switzerland Loans, Barnes Switzerland promises to pay, on the Loan Maturity Date, and there shall become absolutely due and payable on the Loan Maturity Date, all of the Loans outstanding on such date, together with any and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that BGI, Barnes Germany, Barnes Luxembourg and/or Barnes Switzerland, as the case may be, shall repay each Swing Line Loan on the earlier to occur of (i) the date ten (10) Business Days after such Loan is made and (ii) the Loan Maturity Date.
3.2    Mandatory Repayments of Loans. If at any time (a) the sum of the outstanding amount of the Loans, the Maximum Drawing Amount and all Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations exceeds the Total Commitment at such time or (b) the sum of the outstanding amount of all Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies exceeds the Alternative Currency Sublimit at such time, then BGI shall immediately pay or (solely in the case of the Barnes Germany Loans) shall cause Barnes Germany to pay or (solely in the case of the Barnes Luxembourg Loans) shall cause Barnes Luxembourg to pay or (solely in the case of the Barnes Switzerland Loans) shall cause Barnes Switzerland to pay the amount of such excess to the Administrative Agent for the respective accounts of the Lenders for application: first, to any Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations; second, to the Loans; and third, to Cash Collateralize the Reimbursement Obligations. Subject to §5.14, each payment of any Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations or prepayment of Loans shall be applied to the Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations or the Loans of the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitment Percentages. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) any payments by Barnes Germany shall be applied solely to the Barnes Germany Loans or Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations or Reimbursement Obligations in respect of Letters of Credit issued for the account of Barnes Germany, (ii) any payments by
48





Barnes Luxembourg shall be applied solely to the Barnes Luxembourg Loans or Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations or Reimbursement Obligations in respect of Letters of Credit issued for the account of Barnes Luxembourg, and (iii) any payments by Barnes Switzerland shall be applied solely to the Barnes Switzerland Loans or Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations or Reimbursement Obligations in respect of Letters of Credit issued for the account of Barnes Switzerland.

The applicable Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent, no later than 11:00 a.m. (Eastern time) (i) at least one (1) Business Day prior written notice of any proposed prepayment pursuant to this §3.3 of Base Rate Loans, (ii) at least three (3) Eurocurrency Business Days’ notice of any proposed prepayment pursuant to this §3.3 of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars, and (iii) at least four (4) Eurocurrency Business Days (or five (5), in the case of prepayment of Loans denominated in Special Notice Currencies) written notice of any proposed prepayment pursuant to this §3.3 of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies, in each case specifying the proposed date of prepayment of Loans and the principal amount to be prepaid. Each such partial prepayment of the Loans shall be in an integral multiple of $1,000,000, shall be accompanied by the payment of accrued interest on the principal prepaid to the date of prepayment and shall be applied, in the absence of instruction by the applicable Borrower, first to the principal of Base Rate Loans and then to the principal of Eurocurrency Rate Loans. Subject to §5.14, each such prepayment shall be applied to the Loans of the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitment Percentages.
4.    LETTERS OF CREDIT.

(iii)    except as otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, such Letter of Credit is in an initial face amount less than $100,000;
(iv)    except as otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, such Letter of Credit is to be denominated in a currency other than Dollars or an Alternative Currency;
(v)    the Issuing Bank does not as of the issuance date of such requested Letter of Credit issue Letters of Credit in the requested currency;
50





(vi)    such Letter of Credit contains any provisions for automatic reinstatement of the stated amount after any drawing thereunder; or
(vii)    any Lender is at that time a Defaulting Lender, unless the Issuing Bank has entered into arrangements, including the delivery of Cash Collateral, satisfactory to the Issuing Bank (in its sole discretion) with the applicable Borrower or such Lender to eliminate the Issuing Bank’s actual or potential Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to §5.14.1(d)) with respect to the Defaulting Lender arising from either the Letter of Credit then proposed to be issued or that Letter of Credit and all other Letter of Credit Obligations as to which the Issuing Bank has actual or potential Fronting Exposure, as it may elect in its sole discretion.
4.2    Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; Auto-Extension Letters of Credit.
(a)    Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of the applicable Borrower delivered to the Issuing Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the applicable Borrower. Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (Eastern time) at least two Business Days (or such later date and time as the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank may agree in a particular instance in their sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the Issuing Bank: (i) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (ii) the amount and currency thereof and in the absence of specification of currency shall be deemed a request for a Letter of Credit denominated in Dollars; (iii) the expiry date thereof; (iv) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (v) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (vi) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (vii) such other matters as the Issuing Bank may require. In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the Issuing Bank (w) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (x) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (y) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (z) such other matters as the Issuing Bank may require. Additionally, the applicable Borrower shall furnish to the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent such other documents and information pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit issuance or amendment, including any Issuer Documents, as the Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent may require.
(b)    Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application at the address set forth in §16.6 for receiving Letter of Credit Applications and related correspondence, the Issuing Bank will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing)
51





that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Application from the applicable Borrower and, if not, the Issuing Bank will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Unless the Issuing Bank has received written notice from any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any Loan Party, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions in §12 shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Issuing Bank shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the applicable Borrower (or the applicable Subsidiary) or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with the Issuing Bank’s usual and customary business practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Issuing Bank a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lender’s Commitment Percentage times the amount of such Letter of Credit.
(c)    Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the Issuing Bank will also deliver to the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment.
(d)    If any Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole and absolute discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an “Auto-Extension Letter of Credit”); provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit the Issuing Bank to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the “Non-Extension Notice Date”) in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the Issuing Bank, no Borrower shall be required to make a specific request to the Issuing Bank for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the Issuing Bank to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date; provided, however, that the Issuing Bank shall not permit any such extension if (A) the Issuing Bank has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of clause (b) or (c) of §4.1 or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is five Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the applicable Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in §12 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing the Issuing Bank not to permit such extension.
52





(e)    The Administrative Agent will notify the Lenders, on a quarterly basis, of all Letters of Credit outstanding.
4.3    Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.
(a)    Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank shall notify the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof. In the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the applicable Borrower shall reimburse the Issuing Bank in such Alternative Currency, unless (i) the Issuing Bank (at its option) shall have specified in such notice that it will require reimbursement in Dollars, or (ii) in the absence of any such requirement for reimbursement in Dollars, the applicable Borrower shall have notified the Issuing Bank promptly following receipt of the notice of drawing that the applicable Borrower will reimburse the Issuing Bank in Dollars. In the case of any such reimbursement in Dollars of a drawing under a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the Issuing Bank shall notify the applicable Borrower of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the drawing promptly following the determination thereof. Not later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of any payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in Dollars, or the Applicable Time on the date of any payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in an Alternative Currency (each such date, an “Honor Date”), the applicable Borrower shall reimburse the Issuing Bank through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing and in the applicable currency. In the event that (A) a drawing denominated in an Alternative Currency is to be reimbursed in Dollars pursuant to the second sentence in this §4.3(a) and (B) the Dollar amount paid by the applicable Borrower, whether on or after the Honor Date, shall not be adequate on the date of that payment to purchase in accordance with normal banking procedures a sum denominated in the Alternative Currency equal to the drawing, the applicable Borrower agrees, as a separate and independent obligation, to indemnify the Issuing Bank for the loss resulting from its inability on that date to purchase the Alternative Currency in the full amount of the drawing. If the applicable Borrower fails to so reimburse the Issuing Bank by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the Unpaid Reimbursement Obligation (expressed in Dollars in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent thereof in the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency), and the amount of such Lender’s Commitment Percentage thereof. In such event, the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Credit Loan which is a Base Rate Loan to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unpaid Reimbursement Obligation, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in §2.6 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Total Commitment and the conditions set forth in §12 (other than the delivery of a Loan Request). Any notice given by the Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this §4.3(a) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.
53





(b)    Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to §4.3(a) make funds available (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral provided for this purpose) to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank, in Dollars, at the Administrative Agent’s Office for Dollar-denominated payments in an amount equal to its Commitment Percentage of the Unpaid Reimbursement Obligation not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of 4.3(c), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Revolving Credit Loan which is a Base Rate Loan to the applicable Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Issuing Bank in Dollars.
(c)    With respect to any Unpaid Reimbursement Obligation that is not fully refinanced by a Revolving Credit Loan which is a Base Rate Loan because the conditions set forth in §12 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the Issuing Bank a Letter of Credit Borrowing in the amount of the Unpaid Reimbursement Obligation that is not so refinanced, which Letter of Credit Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the rate set forth for Base Rate Loans in §6.11. In such event, each Lender’s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank pursuant to §4.3(b) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such Letter of Credit Borrowing and shall constitute a Letter of Credit Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this §4.3.
(d)    Until each Lender funds its Revolving Credit Loan which is a Base Rate Loan or Letter of Credit Advance pursuant to this §4.3 to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender’s Commitment Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the Issuing Bank.
(e)    Each Lender’s obligation to make a Revolving Credit Loan which is a Base Rate Loan or Letter of Credit Advances to reimburse the Issuing Bank for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this §4.3, shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Issuing Bank, the applicable Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (iii) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Lender’s obligation to make a Revolving Credit Loan which is a Base Rate Loan pursuant to this §4.3 is subject to the conditions set forth in §12 (other than delivery by the applicable Borrower of a Loan Request). No such making of a Letter of Credit Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the applicable Borrower to reimburse the Issuing Bank for the amount of any payment made by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.
54





(f)    If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this §4.3 by the time specified in §4.3(b), the Issuing Bank shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Issuing Bank at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Issuing Bank in connection with the foregoing. A certificate of the Issuing Bank submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
4.4    Repayment of Participations.
(a)    At any time after the Issuing Bank has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such Lender’s Letter of Credit Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with §4.3, if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of the Issuing Bank any payment in respect of the related Unpaid Reimbursement Obligation or interest thereon (whether directly from the applicable Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Commitment Percentage thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender’s Letter of Credit Advance was outstanding) in Dollars and in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent.
(b)    If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank pursuant to §4.3(a) is required to be returned in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Issuing Bank in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank its Commitment Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Credit Agreement.
4.5    Obligations Absolute.
The obligation of the applicable Borrower to reimburse the Issuing Bank for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each Letter of Credit Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Credit Agreement under all circumstances, including the following:
(a)    any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Credit Agreement, or any other Loan Document;
55





(b)    the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that any Borrower or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the Issuing Bank or any other Person, whether in connection with this Credit Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction;
(c)    any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit;
(d)    any payment by the Issuing Bank under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the Issuing Bank under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law;
(e)    any adverse change in the relevant exchange rates or in the availability of the relevant Alternative Currency to any Borrower or any Subsidiary or in the relevant currency markets generally;
(f)    any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Borrower or any Subsidiary; or
(g)    any adverse change in the relevant exchange rates or in the availability of the relevant Alternative Currency to the Borrowers or any Subsidiary or in the relevant currency markets generally.
The applicable Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with the applicable Borrower’s instructions or other irregularity, the applicable Borrower will immediately notify the Issuing Bank. The applicable Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the Issuing Bank and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.
4.6    Role of Issuing Bank.
Each Lender and each of the Borrowers agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to
56





ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the Issuing Bank shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document. Each Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude such Borrower from pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the Issuing Bank, shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (a) through (e) of §4.5; provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the applicable Borrower may have a claim against the Issuing Bank, and the Issuing Bank may be liable to the applicable Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by such Borrower which such Borrower proves were caused by the Issuing Bank’s willful misconduct or gross negligence or the Issuing Bank’s willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the Issuing Bank shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.
4.7    Applicability of ISP.
Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the Issuing Bank and the applicable Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued (including any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit), the rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit.
4.8    Letter of Credit Amounts.
Unless otherwise specified herein the amount of a Letter of Credit at any time shall be deemed to be the Maximum Drawing Amount of such Letter of Credit in effect at such time; provided, however, that with respect to any Letter of Credit that, by its terms or the terms of any Issuer Document related thereto, provides for one or more automatic increases in the Maximum Drawing Amount thereof, the Maximum Drawing Amount of such Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be the maximum drawing amount of such Letter of Credit after giving effect to all such increases, whether or not such maximum drawing amount is in effect at such time.
57





4.9    Letter of Credit Fee. The applicable Borrower shall pay (a) a fee (the “Letter of Credit Fee”) equal to the Applicable Margin on the Maximum Drawing Amount of the Letters of Credit (other than Performance Letters of Credit), in Dollars, to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, to be shared pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitment Percentages and (b) a fee equal to one-half of the Applicable Margin on the Maximum Drawing Amount of the Performance Letters of Credit (the “Performance Letter of Credit Fee”, collectively with the Letter of Credit Fee, the “Letter of Credit Fees”) to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, to be shared pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitment Percentages; provided, however, any Letter of Credit Fees otherwise payable for the account of a Defaulting Lender with respect to any Letter of Credit as to which such Defaulting Lender has not provided Cash Collateral satisfactory to the Issuing Bank pursuant to this §4.9 shall be payable, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, to the other Lenders in accordance with the upward adjustments in their respective Commitment Percentages allocable to such Letter of Credit pursuant to §5.14.1(d), with the balance of such fee, if any, payable to the Issuing Bank for its own account. The Letter of Credit Fees shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the first day following the end of each calendar quarter for the quarter just ended, with the first such payment commencing on the first such date following the date hereof, and on the Loan Maturity Date. In addition, a fronting fee equal to the percentage separately agreed upon in a letter between the applicable Borrower and the applicable Issuing Bank, computed on the amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit shall be payable quarterly in arrears by the applicable Borrower to such Issuing Bank for its account in accordance with the terms of such letter, and the applicable Borrower shall pay to such Issuing Bank any amendment, negotiation or document examination and other administrative fees charged by such Issuing Bank in connection with Letters of Credit as in effect from time to time.
5.    CERTAIN GENERAL PROVISIONS.

5.1    Administrative Agent’s Fee. BGI shall pay to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Agent’s fee (the “Administrative Agent’s Fee”) in such amount and at such times as set forth in the Fee Letter.
5.2    Funds for Payments. Except with respect to principal of and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, all payments of principal, interest, Reimbursement Obligations, Fees and any other amounts due hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents shall be made on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent in Dollars, for the respective accounts of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, at the Administrative Agent’s Office or at such other place that the Administrative Agent may from time to time designate, in each case at or about 11:00 a.m. (Eastern time or other local time at the place of payment) and in Same Day Funds. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder with respect to principal and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent’s Office in such Alternative Currency and in Same Day Funds not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent on the dates specified herein. Without limiting the generality of the
58





foregoing, the Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this Credit Agreement be made in the United States. If, for any reason, any Borrower is prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency, such Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative Currency payment amount. All payments to be made by the Borrowers shall be made free and clear of and without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.
5.3    Computations; Retroactive Adjustments of Applicable Margin.
(a)    Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all computations of interest, and, the Facility Fee, the Letter of Credit Fees or other fees shall be based on a 360-day year and paid for the actual number of days elapsed, except that computations based on the Base Rate shall be based on a 365 or 366, as applicable, day year and paid for the actual number of days elapsed, and computations of interest in respect of Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies as to which market practices differ from the foregoing, shall be made in accordance with such market practice. Whenever a payment hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents becomes due on a day that is not a Business Day, the due date for such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and interest shall accrue during such extension; provided that for any Interest Period for any Eurocurrency Rate Loan if such next succeeding Business Day falls in the next succeeding calendar month or after the Loan Maturity Date, it shall be deemed to end on the next preceding Business Day.
(b)    If, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of BGI or its Subsidiaries resulting from the error of BGI or its Subsidiaries, including any of their agents or advisors, BGI or the Lenders determine that (i) the Leverage Ratio as calculated by BGI as of any applicable date was inaccurate and (ii) a proper calculation of the Leverage Ratio would have resulted in higher pricing for such period, the Borrowers shall immediately and retroactively be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders, promptly on demand by the Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Borrowers under any Debtor Relief Law, automatically and without further action by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank), an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for the applicable period of such inaccuracy over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period. This paragraph shall not limit the rights of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, under §§4.3(c), 4.9 or 5.10 or under Article 13. The Borrowers’ obligations under this paragraph shall survive the termination of the Commitments and the repayment of all other Obligations hereunder.
5.4    Inability to Determine Eurocurrency Rate.
(a)    If in connection with any request for a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof, (i) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders determines that (A) deposits (whether in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) are
59





not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for such currency for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, (B) (x) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan and (y) the circumstances described in §5.4(c)(i) do not apply, or (C) a fundamental change has occurred in the foreign exchange for interbank markets with respect to such Alternative Currency (including, without limitation, changes in national or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls) (in each case with respect to this clause (i), “Impacted Loans”), or (ii) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders determine that for any reason the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrowers and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be suspended in the affected currency or currencies, (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurocurrency Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a determination by the Required Lenders described in clause (ii) of §5.4(a), until the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the applicable Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein and (ii) (A) any outstanding affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars will be deemed to have been converted into Base Rate Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period and (B) any outstanding affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, at the applicable Borrower’s election, shall either (1) be converted into a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans denominated in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of such outstanding Eurocurrency Rate Loan at the end of the applicable Interest Period or (2) be prepaid at the end of the applicable Interest Period in full; provided that if no election is made by the applicable Borrower by the earlier of (x) the date that is three Business Days after receipt by the applicable Borrower of such notice and (y) the last day of the current Interest Period for the applicable Eurocurrency Rate Loan, the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have elected clause (1) above.
(b)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in clause (i) of §5.4(a), the Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Borrowers and Required Lenders, may establish an alternative interest rate for the Impacted Loans, in which case, such alternative rate of interest shall apply with
60





respect to the Impacted Loans until (i) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the Impacted Loans under clause (i) of the first sentence of §5.4(a), (ii) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (iii) any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers written notice thereof. The Administrative Agent will promptly (in one or more notices) notify the Borrowers and each Lender of the establishment of an alternative interest rate pursuant to this clause (b).
(c)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Credit Agreement or any other Loan Documents, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the Borrowers or Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the Required Lenders, a copy to the Borrower) that the Borrowers or Required Lenders (as applicable) have determined, that:
(i)    adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR for an Alternative Currency for any Interest Period hereunder or any other tenors of LIBOR, including, without limitation, because the LIBOR Screen Rate for such Alternative Currency is not available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or
(ii)    the administrator of the LIBOR Screen Rate for an Alternative Currency or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent or such administrator has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which LIBOR for an Alternative Currency or the LIBOR Screen Rate for an Alternative Currency shall no longer be made available, or used for determining the interest rate of loans denominated in such Alternative Currency, provided that, in each case, at the time of such statement, there is no successor administrator that is satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, that will continue to provide LIBOR for such Alternative Currency after such specific date (such specific date, the “Scheduled Unavailability Date”); or
(iii)    the administrator of the LIBOR Screen Rate for an Alternative Currency or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over such administrator has made a public statement announcing that all Interest Periods and other tenors of LIBOR for such Alternative Currency are no longer representative; or
(iv)    syndicated loans currently being executed, or that include language similar to that contained in this §5.4, are being executed or amended (as applicable) to incorporate or adopt a new benchmark interest rate to replace LIBOR for an Alternative Currency;
61





then, in the case of clauses (i)-(iii) above, on a date and time determined by the Administrative Agent (any such date, the “LIBOR Replacement Date”), which date shall be at the end of an Interest Period or on the relevant interest payment date, as applicable, for interest calculated and shall occur within a reasonable period of time after the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances under clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above and, solely with respect to clause (ii) above, no later than the Scheduled Unavailability Date, LIBOR, in the case of Dollars, will be replaced hereunder and under any Loan Document with, subject to the proviso below, the first available alternative set forth in the order below for any payment period for interest calculated that can be determined by the Administrative Agent, in each case, without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document (the “LIBOR Successor Rate”; and any such rate before giving effect to the Related Adjustment, the “Pre-Adjustment Successor Rate”):
(x)    Term SOFR plus the Related Adjustment; and
(y)     SOFR plus the Related Adjustment;
and in the case of clause (iv) above, the Borrowers and Administrative Agent may amend this Credit Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing LIBOR for such Alternative Currency under this Credit Agreement and under any other Loan Document in accordance with the definition of “LIBOR Successor Rate” and such amendment will become effective at 5:00 p.m., on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have notified all Lenders and the Borrowers of the occurrence of the circumstances described in clause (iv) above unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders object to the implementation of a LIBOR Successor Rate pursuant to such clause;
provided that, if the Administrative Agent determines that Term SOFR has become available, is administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent and would have been identified as the Pre-Adjustment Successor Rate in accordance with the foregoing if it had been so available at the time that the LIBOR Successor Rate for Dollars then in effect was so identified, and the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrowers and each Lender of such availability, then from and after the beginning of the Interest Period, relevant interest payment date or payment period for interest calculated, in each case, commencing no less than thirty (30) days after the date of such notice, the Pre-Adjustment Successor Rate shall be Term SOFR and the LIBOR Successor Rate shall be Term SOFR plus the relevant Related Adjustment.
The Administrative Agent will promptly (in one or more notices) notify the Borrowers and each Lender of (x) any occurrence of any of the events, periods or circumstances under clauses (i) through (iii) above, (y) a LIBOR Replacement Date and (z) the LIBOR Successor Rate.
Any LIBOR Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice; provided that to the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent, such LIBOR Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent.
62





Notwithstanding anything else herein, if at any time any LIBOR Successor Rate as so determined would otherwise be less than zero, the LIBOR Successor Rate will be deemed to be zero for the purposes of this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
In connection with the implementation of a LIBOR Successor Rate, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make LIBOR Successor Rate Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such LIBOR Successor Rate Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Credit Agreement; provided that, with respect to any such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such LIBOR Successor Rate Conforming Changes to the Borrowers and the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective.
If the events or circumstances of the type described in §5.4(c)(i)-(iii) have occurred with respect to the LIBOR Successor Rate then in effect, then the successor rate thereto shall be determined in accordance with the definition of “LIBOR Successor Rate.”
(d)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) after any such determination by the Administrative Agent or receipt by the Administrative Agent of any such notice described under §5.4(c)(i)-(iii), as applicable, if the Administrative Agent determines that none of the LIBOR Successor Rates is available on or prior to the LIBOR Replacement Date, (ii) if the events or circumstances described in §5.4(c)(iv) have occurred but none of the LIBOR Successor Rates is available, or (iii) if the events or circumstances of the type described in §5.4(c)(i)-(iii) have occurred with respect to the LIBOR Successor Rate then in effect and the Administrative Agent determines that none of the LIBOR Successor Rates is available, then in each case, the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers may amend this Credit Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing LIBOR or any then current LIBOR Successor Rate in accordance with this §5.4 at the end of any Interest Period, relevant interest payment date or payment period for interest calculated, as applicable, with another alternate benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollar denominated syndicated credit facilities for such alternative benchmarks and, in each case, including any Related Adjustments and any other mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollar denominated syndicated credit facilities for such benchmarks, which adjustment or method for calculating such adjustment shall be published on an information service as selected by the Administrative Agent from time to time in its reasonable discretion and may be periodically updated. For the avoidance of doubt, any such proposed rate and adjustments shall constitute a LIBOR Successor Rate. Any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrowers unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders object to such amendment.
63





(e)    If, at the end of any Interest Period, relevant interest payment date or payment period for interest calculated, no LIBOR Successor Rate has been determined in accordance with clauses (c) or (d) of this §5.4 and the circumstances under clauses (c)(i) or (c)(iii) above exist or the Scheduled Unavailability Date has occurred (as applicable), the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrowers and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies shall be suspended, (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans, Interest Periods, interest payment dates or payment periods), and (y) the Eurocurrency Rate component shall no longer be utilized in determining the Base Rate, until the LIBOR Successor Rate has been determined in accordance with clauses (c) or (d). Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrowers may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans, Interest Periods, interest payment dates or payment periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans (subject to the foregoing clause (y)) in the amount specified therein.
5.5    Illegality. (a) If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Eurocurrency Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrowers through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be suspended, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) BGI shall prepay or, solely in the case of the Barnes Germany Loans, Barnes Germany shall prepay or, solely in the case of the Barnes Luxembourg Loans, Barnes Luxembourg shall prepay or, solely in the case of the Barnes Switzerland Loans, Barnes Switzerland shall prepay, in each case, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or, if applicable, convert all Eurocurrency Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without
64





reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component thereof until the Administrative is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
(b)    Each Lender may at its option make any Loan to any Borrower by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the relevant Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Credit Agreement; provided, further, that notwithstanding which domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender makes such Loan to any Borrower, BGI shall only be required to repay such Loan to the Administrative Agent in the United States of America or the United Kingdom, Barnes Germany shall only be required to repay such Loans to the Administrative Agent in the United States of America, Germany or the United Kingdom, Barnes Luxembourg shall only be required to repay such Loans to the Administrative Agent in the United States of America, Luxembourg or the United Kingdom, and Barnes Switzerland shall only be required to repay such Loans to the Administrative Agent in the United States of America, Switzerland or the United Kingdom, in each case, otherwise in accordance with §5.2.
5.6    Additional Costs, Etc. (a) General. If any Change in Law shall:
(i)    impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement) or the Issuing Bank;
(ii)    subject any Lender or the Issuing Bank to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Credit Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any participation in a Letter of Credit or any Eurocurrency Rate Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender or the Issuing Bank in respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes, Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes, or Connection Income Taxes); or
(iii)    impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Credit Agreement or Eurocurrency Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or the Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or the Issuing Bank, the Borrowers will pay to
65





such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b)    [Reserved.]
(c)    Reserves on Eurocurrency Rate Loans. The applicable Borrower shall pay to each Lender, (i) as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as “Eurocurrency liabilities”), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurocurrency Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), and (ii) as long as such Lender shall be required to comply with any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the maintenance of the Commitments or the funding of the Loans, such additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Commitment or Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which in each case shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan, provided the Borrowers shall have received at least ten (10) days’ prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest or costs from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice ten (10) days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable ten (10) days from receipt of such notice.
5.7    Capital Adequacy. If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the Issuing Bank or any Eurocurrency Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Credit Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity) then such Lender or the Administrative Agent may notify the Borrowers of such fact in writing. To the extent that the amount of such reduction in the return on capital is not reflected in the Base Rate, BGI agrees to pay or, solely in the case of the Barnes Germany Loans, Barnes Germany agrees to pay or, solely in the case of the Barnes Luxembourg Loans, Barnes Luxembourg agrees to pay or, solely in the case of the Barnes Switzerland Loans, Barnes Switzerland agrees to pay, such Lender or (as the case may be) the Administrative Agent for the amount of such reduction in the return on capital as and when such reduction is determined within 30 days of presentation by such Lender or (as the case may be) the Administrative Agent
66





of a certificate in accordance with §5.8 hereof. Each Lender shall allocate such cost increases among its customers in good faith and on an equitable basis.
5.8    Certificate. A certificate setting forth any additional amounts payable pursuant to §§5.6 or 5.7 showing the calculation in reasonable detail, submitted by any Lender or the Administrative Agent to the Borrowers, shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, that such amounts are due and owing. The Lender or the Administrative Agent shall notify the applicable Borrower within 180 days after it becomes aware of the imposition of such additional amount or amounts; provided that if such Lender or the Administrative Agent fails to so notify such Borrower within such 180 day period, such Lender or the Administrative Agent shall not be entitled to claim any additional amount or amounts pursuant to this subsection for any period ending on a date which is prior to 180 days before such notification (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180 day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
5.9    Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrowers shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:
(a)    any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);
(b)    any failure by the Borrowers (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrowers;
(c)    any assignment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by a Borrower pursuant to §5.11; or
(d)    any failure by any Borrower to make payment of any Loan or drawing under any Letter of Credit (or interest due thereon) denominated in an Alternative Currency on its scheduled due date or any payment thereof in a different currency;
including any loss of anticipated profits, any foreign exchange losses and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the performance of any foreign exchange contract. The Borrowers shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.
For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrowers to the Lenders under this §5.9, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurocurrency Rate Loan made by it at the Eurocurrency Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank Eurocurrency market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurocurrency Rate Loan was in fact so funded.
67





5.10    Interest After Default.
5.10.1.    Overdue Amounts. Overdue principal on the Loans and (to the extent permitted by applicable law) overdue interest on the Loans and all other overdue amounts payable hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents shall bear interest, payable on demand, at a rate per annum equal to two percent (2%) above the rate of interest then applicable thereto (or, if no rate of interest is then applicable thereto, two percent (2%) above the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin), including (without duplication) any Applicable Margin, until such amount shall be paid in full (after as well as before judgment).
5.10.2.    Amounts Not Overdue. During the continuance of an Event of Default the principal of the Loans not overdue shall, until such Event of Default has been cured or remedied or such Event of Default has been waived by the Required Lenders pursuant to §16.12, shall, upon written notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, bear interest, payable on demand, at a rate per annum equal to two percent (2%) above the rate of interest then applicable thereto (or, if no rate of interest is then applicable thereto, two percent (2%) above the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin), including (without duplication) any Applicable Margin.
5.11    Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
5.11.1.    Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests compensation under §§5.6 or 5.7, or a Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender, the Issuing Bank, or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to §5.12, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to §5.5, then such Lender or the Issuing Bank shall, as applicable, use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender or the Issuing Bank, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to §§5.6, 5.7 or 5.12, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to §§5.5, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be. The Borrowers hereby agree to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender or the Issuing Bank in connection with any such designation or assignment.
5.11.2.    Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender (an “Affected Lender”) (a) makes demand upon the Borrowers for (or if the Borrowers are otherwise required to pay) amounts pursuant to §§5.6 or 5.7, (b) is unable to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans as a result of a condition described in §5.5 or (c) is a Defaulting Lender, or if any other circumstance exists that gives the Borrowers express right to replace a Lender hereunder, the Borrowers may, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing, within ninety (90) days of (i) receipt of such demand, notice (or the occurrence of such other event causing the Borrowers to be required to pay such
68





compensation or causing §5.5 to be applicable), or (ii) such default or circumstance giving the Borrowers such express right to replace a Lender hereunder, as the case may be, by notice (a “Replacement Notice”) in writing to the Administrative Agent and such Affected Lender (i) request the Affected Lender to cooperate with the Borrowers in obtaining a replacement Lender satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers (the “Replacement Lender”); (ii) request the non-Affected Lenders to acquire and assume all of the Affected Lender’s Loans and Commitment as provided herein, but none of such Lenders shall be under an obligation to do so; or (iii) designate a Replacement Lender approved by the Administrative Agent, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If any satisfactory Replacement Lender shall be obtained, and/or if any one or more of the non-Affected Lenders shall agree to acquire and assume all of the Affected Lender’s Loans and Commitment, then such Affected Lender shall assign, in accordance with §15, all of its Commitment, Loans, Letter of Credit Participations, Notes and other rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement and all other Loan Documents to such Replacement Lender or non-Affected Lenders, as the case may be, in exchange for payment of the principal amount so assigned and all interest and fees accrued on the amount so assigned, plus all other Obligations then due and payable to the Affected Lender; provided, however, that (A) such assignment shall be without recourse, representation or warranty and shall be on terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to such Affected Lender and such Replacement Lender and/or non-Affected Lenders, as the case may be, and (B) prior to any such assignment, the applicable Borrower shall have paid to such Affected Lender all amounts properly demanded and unreimbursed under §§5.6 and 5.7. Upon the effective date of such assignment, the Borrowers shall issue replacement Notes to such Replacement Lender and/or non-Affected Lenders, as the case may be, and such institution shall become a “Lender” for all purposes under this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
5.12    Taxes.
5.12.1.    Payments Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Payments on Account of Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall to the extent permitted by applicable Laws be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes. If, however, applicable Laws (in the good faith determination of any Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as applicable) require any Borrower or the Administrative Agent to withhold or deduct any Tax, such Tax shall be withheld or deducted in accordance with such Laws as determined by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, upon the basis of the information and documentation to be delivered pursuant to subsection (e) below.
(b)    If any Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall be required by the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes, including both United States Federal backup withholding and withholding taxes, from any payment, then (A) such Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent to be required based upon the information and
69





documentation it has received pursuant to subsection (e) below, (B) such Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with the Code, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the sum payable by such Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.
(c)    If any Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall be required by any applicable Laws other than the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes from any payment, then (A) such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as required by such Laws, shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by it to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to §5.12.5 below, (B) such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, to the extent required by such Laws, shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with such Laws, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this §5.12) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.
5.12.2.    Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrowers. Each Borrower shall pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Laws, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.
5.12.3.    Tax Indemnifications. (a) Without limiting the provisions of §§5.12.1 and 5.12.2 above, the Borrowers shall, and do hereby, indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Bank, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by, or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. Each Borrower shall also, and does hereby, indemnify the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, for any amount which a Lender or the Issuing Bank for any reason fails to pay indefeasibly to the Administrative Agent as required by clause (b) of this subsection incurred by the Administrative Agent. A certificate as to the amount of any such payment or liability delivered to the Borrowers by a Lender or the Issuing Bank (with a copy to the
70





Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(b)    Without limiting the provisions of §§5.12.1 and 5.12.2 above, each Lender and the Issuing Bank shall, and does hereby, indemnify each Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, against any and all Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities, penalties, interest and expenses (including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent) incurred by or asserted against such Borrower or the Administrative Agent by any Governmental Authority as a result of the failure by such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to (i) fail to comply with the provisions of §15.3 relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register or (ii) deliver, or as a result of the inaccuracy, inadequacy or deficiency of, any documentation required to be delivered by such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to such Borrower or the Administrative Agent pursuant to §5.12.5. Each Lender and the Issuing Bank hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, under this Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this clause (b). The agreements in this clause (b) shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender or the Issuing Bank, the termination of the Total Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.
5.12.4.    Evidence of Payments. Upon request by any Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, after any payment of Taxes by such Borrower or by the Administrative Agent to a Governmental Authority as provided in this §5.12, such Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent shall deliver to such Borrower, as the case may be, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return required by law to report such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be.
5.12.5.    Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation.
(a)    Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrowers and to the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by applicable Laws or when reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable Laws or by the taxing authorities of any jurisdiction and such other reasonably requested information as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by BGI or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by BGI or the Administrative Agent as will enable BGI or
71





the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in §5.12.5(b)(i), (ii) or (iv) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
(b)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that a Borrower is a U.S. Borrower,
(i)    any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to such Borrower and the Administrative Agent executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or such other documentation or information prescribed by applicable Laws or reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements; and
(ii)    any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to such Borrowers and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Credit Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of such Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
(A)    in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as applicable) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as applicable) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty;
(B)    executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI,
(C)    in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit L-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of a Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax
72





Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as applicable); or
(D)    to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as applicable), a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit L-2 or Exhibit L-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit L-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
(iii)    any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Credit Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent), executed copies (or originals, as required) of any other form prescribed by applicable Laws as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Laws to permit such Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
(iv)    if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to BGI and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by BGI or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by BGI or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for BGI and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Credit Agreement.
(c)    Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this §5.21 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall
73





update such form or certification or promptly notify BGI and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
(d)    Each Lender shall promptly (A) notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction, and (B) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Eurocurrency Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws of any jurisdiction that the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent make any withholding or deduction for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender.
5.12.6.    Treatment of Certain Refunds. Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Bank, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender or the Issuing Bank, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be. If the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Borrower or with respect to which such Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this §5.12, it shall pay to such Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower under this §5.12 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that such Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank in the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as applicable, be required to pay any amount to such Loan Party pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as applicable, in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Loan Party or any other Person.
5.12.7.    Survival. Each party’s obligations under this §5.12 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or
74





the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments, the expiration or cancellation of all Letters of Credit and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.
5.13    Cash Collateral.
5.13.1.    Certain Credit Support Events. Upon the request of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank (i) if the Issuing Bank has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in a Letter of Credit Borrowing and an Event of Default exists, the applicable Borrower shall immediately Cash Collateralize the then outstanding amount of all Letter of Credit Obligations, or (ii) if, as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date with respect to any Letter of Credit, any Letter of Credit Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, the applicable Borrower shall immediately Cash Collateralize the then outstanding amount of any Letter of Credit Obligations in respect of all Letters of Credit expiring on such Letter of Credit Expiration Date. Upon the request of the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, if an Event of Default exists, the Borrowers shall Cash Collateralize the then outstanding amount of Letter of Credit Obligations (if any). At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, immediately upon the request of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swing Line Lender, the Borrowers shall deliver to the Administrative Agent Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to cover all Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to §5.14.1(d) and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).
5.13.2.    Grant of Security Interest. All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in one or more blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts with the Administrative Agent. The Borrowers, and to the extent provided by any Lender, such Lender, hereby grants to (and subjects to the control of) the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders (including the Swing Line Lender), and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein, and all other property so provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to §5.13.3. If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the applicable Fronting Exposure and other obligations secured thereby, the Borrowers or the relevant Defaulting Lender will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency.
5.13.3.    Application. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Credit Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under any of this §5.13 or §§4 or 5.14 in respect of Letters of Credit or Swing Line Loans shall be held and applied to the satisfaction of the specific Letter of Credit Obligations, Swing Line Loans, obligations to fund participations therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting
75





Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) and other obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may be provided for herein.
5.13.4.    Release. Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce Fronting Exposure shall be released promptly following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure giving rise thereto (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with §15.1.1(d))) or (ii) the Administrative Agent’s good faith determination that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided, however, (x) that Cash Collateral furnished by or on behalf of a Loan Party shall not be released during the continuance of a Default or Event of Default, and (y) the Person providing Cash Collateral and the Issuing Bank or Swing Line Lender, as applicable, may agree that Cash Collateral shall not be released but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure.
5.14    Defaulting Lenders.
5.14.1    Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Credit Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law:
(a)    Waivers and Amendments. That Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Credit Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in §16.12.
(b)    Reallocation of Payments. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of that Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to §13 or otherwise, and including any amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by that Defaulting Lender pursuant to §16.1), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the Issuing Bank or Swing Line Lender hereunder; third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent or requested by the Issuing Bank or Swing Line Lender, to be held as Cash Collateral for future funding obligations of that Defaulting Lender of any participation in any Swing Line Loan or Letter of Credit; fourth, as the Borrowers may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Credit Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers, to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of that Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Credit Agreement; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the Issuing Bank or Swing Line Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the Issuing Bank or Swing Line Lender
76





against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Credit Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrowers as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Borrower against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Credit Agreement; and eighth, to that Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or Letter of Credit Borrowings in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y) such Loans or Letter of Credit Borrowings were made at a time when the conditions set forth in §12 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and Letter of Credit Borrowings owed to, all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or Letter of Credit Borrowings owed to, that Defaulting Lender. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this §5.14.1(b) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
(c)    Certain Fees. That Defaulting Lender (x) shall be entitled to receive any Facility Fee pursuant to §2.2 for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to extent allocable to the sum of (1) the outstanding amount of the Loans funded by it and (2) its Commitment Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to §§4, 5.13 or §5.14.1(b), as applicable (and the Borrowers shall (A) be required to pay to each of the Issuing Bank and the Swing Line Lender, as applicable, the amount of such fee allocable to its Fronting Exposure arising from that Defaulting Lender and (B) not be required to pay the remaining amount of such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender) and (y) shall be limited in its right to receive Letter of Credit Fees as provided in §4.9.
(d)    Reallocation of Applicable Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure. During any period in which there is a Defaulting Lender, for purposes of computing the amount of the obligation of each non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, refinance or fund Loans, participations in Letters of Credit or Swing Line Loans pursuant to §§2, 2.6.2 and 4, the “Commitment Percentage” of each non-Defaulting Lender shall be computed without giving effect to the Commitment of that Defaulting Lender; provided that, (i) each such reallocation shall be given effect only if, at the date the applicable Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, no Default or Event of Default exists; and (ii) the aggregate obligation of each non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, refinance or fund Loans, participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans shall not exceed the positive difference, if any, of (1) the Commitment of that non-Defaulting Lender minus (2) the aggregate outstanding amount of the Loans of that Lender.
5.14.2.    Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and the Issuing Bank agree in writing in their sole discretion that a
77





Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Commitment Percentages (without giving effect to §5.14.1(d)), whereupon that Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrowers while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.
6.    GUARANTORS.

6.1    Guaranty by Subsidiaries.
(a)    BGI shall cause each of the Significant Subsidiaries (excluding any foreign Subsidiaries or a Subsidiary of a foreign Subsidiary) to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, (i) a Guaranty in the form of Exhibit E attached hereto, and (ii) any other instruments and documents as the Administrative Agent may reasonably require, together with legal opinions in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent to be delivered to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders opining as to authorization, validity and enforceability of such Guaranties.
(b)    To the extent any of BGI’s Subsidiaries agree to provide a guaranty to any of the lenders under the Existing Senior Debt or other Indebtedness permitted hereunder, BGI, if requested by the Administrative Agent with 60 days prior written notice, but in no event later than the grant of such other guaranty, will cause each Subsidiary (excluding any foreign Subsidiaries) that has agreed to guaranty such other Indebtedness to become a Guarantor in accordance with (a) above.

7.3    Title to Properties.

7.5    No Material Adverse Changes, Etc. Since the Balance Sheet Date there has been no change in the business, properties, assets or financial condition of the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries taken as a whole which has had a Material Adverse Effect.

7.7    Litigation. There are no actions, suits, proceedings or investigations of any kind pending or, to BGI’s knowledge, threatened against BGI or any of its Subsidiaries before any Governmental Authority, that, so far as BGI can now reasonably foresee, could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

7.13    Employee Benefit Plans.
7.13.1.    Each Pension Plan is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other Federal or state laws, except where such non-compliance could not reasonably be expected to result in liability of any Borrower or Subsidiary in an aggregate amount in excess of $20,000,000. Each Pension Plan that is intended to be a qualified plan under §401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that the form of such Plan is qualified under §401(a) of the Code and the trust related thereto has been determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be exempt from federal income tax under §501(a) of the Code, or an application for such a letter is currently being processed by the Internal Revenue Service, or such Pension Plan is maintained pursuant to prototype plan documents for which the prototype sponsor has received a favorable Internal Revenue Service opinion letter.

7.13.3.    (i) No ERISA Event has occurred, and no Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate is aware of any fact, event or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to constitute or result in an ERISA Event with respect to any Pension Plan that (in any case)
81





would result in an Event of Default; (ii) each Borrower and each ERISA Affiliate has met all applicable requirements under the Pension Funding Rules in respect of each Pension Plan, and no waiver of the minimum funding standards under the Pension Funding Rules has been applied for or obtained; (iii) as of the most recent valuation date for any Pension Plan, the funding target attainment percentage (as defined in §430(d)(2) of the Code) is 60% or higher and no Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate knows of any facts or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to cause the funding target attainment percentage for any such plan to drop below 60% as of the most recent valuation date; (iv) no Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in a transaction that could be subject to §4069 or §4212(c) of ERISA, (v) no Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability to the PBGC other than for the payment of premiums, and there are no premium payments which have become due that are unpaid; and (vi) no Pension Plan has been terminated by the plan administrator thereof nor by the PBGC, and no event or circumstance has occurred or exists that could reasonably be expected to cause the PBGC to institute proceedings under Title IV of ERISA to terminate any Pension Plan.

9.7    Compliance with Environmental Laws. Except to the extent required by the day-to-day operations of each of the Borrowers and its Subsidiaries, and in all instances in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Environmental Laws, none of the Borrowers will knowingly, and will not knowingly permit any of its Subsidiaries to, (a) use any of the Real Estate or any portion thereof for the handling, processing, storage or disposal of Hazardous Substances, (b) cause or permit to be located on any of the Real Estate any underground tank or other underground storage receptacle for Hazardous Substances, (c) generate any Hazardous Substances on any of the Real Estate, or (d) conduct any activity at any Real Estate or use any Real Estate in any manner so as to cause a release (i.e. releasing, spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting, emptying, discharging, injecting, escaping, leaching, disposing or dumping) or threatened release of Hazardous Substances on, upon or into the Real Estate.

None of the Borrowers will, nor permit
100





any of their Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, use any Credit Extensions or the proceeds of any Credit Extensions for any purpose which would breach the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the UK Bribery Act 2010 or other similar anti-corruption legislation in other jurisdictions in which they conduct business; provided, that this covenant relating to use of proceeds shall be inapplicable, to any Borrower or any Subsidiary, as applicable, that has its registered office (Sitz) in Germany or is managed from Germany, to the extent compliance with this covenant would result in a violation of the German Foreign Trade Act (Außenwirtschaftsgesetz), the German Foreign Trade Ordinance (Außenwirtschaftsverordnung) or would conflict with any provision of the Council Regulation (EC) 2271/1996 or any similar applicable anti-boycott law or regulation.
(b)    None of the Borrowers shall be, nor permit any of their Subsidiaries to be (i) a Person with whom any Lender is restricted from doing business under Executive Order No. 13224 or any other Anti-Corruption/Terrorism Law, (ii) engaged in any business involved in making or receiving any contribution of funds, goods or services to or for the benefit of such a Person or in any transaction that evades or avoids, or has the purpose of evading or avoiding, the prohibitions set forth in any Anti-Corruption/Terrorism Law, or (iii) otherwise in violation of any Anti-Corruption/Terrorism Law in effect in each jurisdiction in which they conduct material operations. The Borrowers shall provide to the Lenders any certifications or information that a Lender reasonably requests to confirm compliance by the Borrowers with Anti-Corruption/Terrorism Laws.
10.    FINANCIAL COVENANTS.

Each of the Borrowers covenants and agrees that, so long as any Loan, Unpaid Reimbursement Obligation, Letter of Credit or Note is outstanding or any Lender has any obligation to make any Loans or the Administrative Agent has any obligation to issue, extend or renew any Letters of Credit:
10.1    Interest Coverage. As of the end of any fiscal quarter, the Borrowers will not permit the ratio of (a) Consolidated EBITDA to (b) Consolidated Cash Interest Expense for the four (4) consecutive fiscal quarters then ending to be less than 4.25:1.
10.2    Leverage Ratio. As of the end of any fiscal quarter, the Borrowers will not permit the ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (excluding, for purposes of calculation of the Leverage Ratio, reverse interest rate swap contracts) as at such date to Consolidated EBITDA for the four (4) consecutive fiscal quarters then ending (the “Leverage Ratio”) to be more than 3.75:1; provided that at the end of each of the first four fiscal quarters ending after the consummation of any acquisition (commencing with, for the avoidance of doubt, the fiscal quarter in which such acquisition was consummated) permitted under §9.5.1 with an aggregate consideration in excess of $150,000,000 (and for purposes of determining pro forma covenant compliance), the Borrowers will not permit the Leverage Ratio to be more than 4.25:1; provided, further, that the increase in the permitted Leverage Ratio level set forth in the immediately preceding proviso shall have no effect during the Covenant Relief Period. Additionally, at all times when any obligations under the 2014 BGI Note Purchase Agreement remain outstanding,
101





the Borrowers shall comply with the Leverage Ratio as defined in the 2014 BGI Note Purchase Agreement.
10.3    Senior Leverage Ratio. As of the end of any fiscal quarter, the Borrowers will not permit the ratio of Consolidated Senior Debt (excluding, for purposes of calculation of the Senior Leverage Ratio, reverse interest rate swap contracts) as at such date to Consolidated EBITDA for the four (4) consecutive fiscal quarters then ending (the “Senior Leverage Ratio”) to be more than (x) in the case of any fiscal quarter ending during the Covenant Relief Period, 3.75:1 and (y) at any other date of determination, 3.25:1; provided that at the end of each of the first four fiscal quarters ending after the consummation of an acquisition (commencing with, for the avoidance of doubt, the fiscal quarter in which such acquisition was consummated) permitted under §9.5.1 with an aggregate consideration in excess of $150,000,000, the Borrowers will not permit the Senior Leverage Ratio to be more than 3.50:1; provided, further, that the increase in the permitted Senior Leverage Ratio level set forth in the immediately preceding proviso shall have no effect during the Covenant Relief Period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing §10.3, if, at any time, the 2014 BGI Note Purchase Agreement is amended to include a senior leverage ratio as then applicable (the “2014 BGI NPA Senior Leverage Ratio”) that is more restrictive than the Senior Leverage Ratio contained in §10.3, then the Borrowers shall provide notice with a certified copy of such amendment to the Administrative Agent. Upon receipt of such notice, the Senior Leverage Ratio permitted by §10.3 shall be deemed to be automatically amended to be as restrictive as the 2014 BGI NPA Senior Leverage Ratio at such time notwithstanding §16.12. If, at any time when such an automatic amendment is in effect, the 2014 BGI NPA Senior Leverage Ratio is amended to be made less restrictive, the Borrowers shall provide notice with a certified copy of such amendment to the Administrative Agent. Upon receipt of such notice, the Senior Leverage Ratio required by §10.3 shall be deemed automatically amended herein to reflect such less restrictive 2014 BGI NPA Senior Leverage Ratio without any further action by any party hereto notwithstanding §16.12; provided, that no such automatic amendment shall cause the maximum Senior Leverage Ratio under §10.3 to exceed 3.75:1.00, as then applicable.
The Borrowers’ obligations to comply with this §10.3 shall terminate upon the repayment in full of all obligations under the 2014 BGI Note Purchase Agreement.

(j)    if any of the Loan Documents shall be cancelled, terminated, revoked or rescinded, in each case otherwise than in accordance with the terms thereof or with the express prior written agreement, consent or approval of the Lenders, or any action at law, suit or in equity or other legal proceeding to cancel, revoke or rescind any of the Loan Documents shall be commenced by or on behalf of any of the Borrowers or their stockholders or any court or any other governmental or regulatory authority or agency of competent jurisdiction shall make a determination that, or issue a judgment, order, decree or ruling to the effect that any one or more of the Loan Documents is illegal, invalid or unenforceable in accordance with the terms thereof;
(k)    (i) An ERISA Event occurs with respect to a Pension Plan or Multiemployer Plan which has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in liability of any Borrower under Title IV of ERISA to the Pension Plan, Multiemployer Plan or the PBGC in an aggregate amount in excess of $30,000,000, or (ii) the Borrowers or any ERISA Affiliate fails to pay when due, after the expiration of any applicable grace period, any installment payment with respect to its withdrawal liability under §4201 of ERISA under a Multiemployer Plan in an aggregate amount in excess of $30,000,000; or
(l)    a Change of Control shall occur;
then, and in any such event, so long as the same may be continuing, the Administrative Agent may, and upon the request of the Required Lenders shall, by notice in writing to the Borrowers declare all amounts owing with respect to this Credit Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents and all Reimbursement Obligations to be, and they shall thereupon forthwith become, immediately due and payable without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrowers; provided that in the event of any Event of Default specified in §§13.1(g) or 13.1(h), all such amounts shall become immediately due and payable automatically and without any requirement of notice from the Administrative Agent or any Lender.
107





13.2    Termination of Commitments. If any one or more of the Events of Default specified in §13.1(g) or §13.1(h) shall occur and be continuing, any unused portion of the credit hereunder shall forthwith terminate and each of the Lenders shall be relieved of all further obligations to make Loans to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent shall be relieved of all further obligations to issue, extend or renew Letters of Credit. If any other Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, or if on any Drawdown Date or other date for issuing, extending or renewing any Letter of Credit the conditions precedent to the making of the Loans to be made on such Drawdown Date or (as the case may be) to issuing, extending or renewing such Letter of Credit on such other date are not satisfied, the Administrative Agent may and, upon the request of the Required Lenders, shall, by notice to the Borrowers, terminate the unused portion of the credit hereunder, and upon such notice being given such unused portion of the credit hereunder shall terminate immediately and each of the Lenders shall be relieved of all further obligations to make Loans and the Administrative Agent shall be relieved of all further obligations to issue, extend or renew Letters of Credit. No termination of the credit hereunder shall relieve the Borrowers of any of the Obligations.
13.3    Remedies. In case any one or more of the Events of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and whether or not the Lenders shall have accelerated the maturity of the Loans pursuant to §13.1, each Lender, if owed any amount with respect to the Loans or the Reimbursement Obligations, may, with the consent of the Required Lenders but not otherwise, proceed to protect and enforce its rights by suit in equity, action at law or other appropriate proceeding, whether for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained in this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any instrument pursuant to which the Obligations to such Lender are evidenced, including as permitted by applicable law the obtaining of the ex parte appointment of a receiver, and, if such amount shall have become due, by declaration or otherwise, proceed to enforce the payment thereof or any other legal or equitable right of such Lender. No remedy herein conferred upon any Lender or the Administrative Agent or the holder of any Note or purchaser of any Letter of Credit Participation is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy and each and every remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or any other provision of law.
14.    THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

14.1    Authorization.
(a)    Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoints Bank of America to act on its behalf as Administrative Agent hereunder and under any of the other Loan Documents and any related documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incident thereto, provided that no duties or responsibilities not expressly assumed herein or therein shall be implied to have been assumed by the Administrative Agent.
108





(b)    The relationship between the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders is that of an independent contractor. The use of the term “Administrative Agent” is for convenience only and is used to describe, as a form of convention, the independent contractual relationship between the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders. Nothing contained in this Credit Agreement nor the other Loan Documents shall be construed to create an agency, trust or other fiduciary relationship between the Administrative Agent and any of the Lenders;
(c)    As an independent contractor empowered by the Lenders to exercise certain rights and perform certain duties and responsibilities hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent is nevertheless a “representative” of the Lenders, as that term is defined in Article 1 of the Uniform Commercial Code, for purposes of actions for the benefit of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent with respect to all collateral security and guaranties contemplated by the Loan Documents. Such actions include the designation of the Administrative Agent as “secured party”, “mortgagee” or the like on all financing statements and other documents and instruments, whether recorded or otherwise, relating to the attachment, perfection, priority or enforcement of any security interests, mortgages or deeds of trust in collateral security intended to secure the payment or performance of any of the Obligations, all for the benefit of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent.
(d)    The Issuing Bank shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and the Issuing Bank shall have all the benefits and immunities (i) provided to the Administrative Agent in this §14 with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by the Issuing Bank in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and the applications and agreements for letters of credit pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term “Administrative Agent” as used in this §14 included the Issuing Bank with respect to such acts or omissions (and including any affiliates of the Issuing Bank and the officers, directors, employees, agents and attorneys-in-fact of the Issuing Bank and any affiliates), and (ii) as additionally provided herein with respect to the Issuing Bank.
(e)    The provisions of this §14 are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, and none of the Borrowers nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions.
14.2    Employees and Administrative Agents. The Administrative Agent may exercise its powers and execute its duties by or through employees or agents and shall be entitled to take, and to rely on, advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to its rights and duties under this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents. The Administrative Agent may utilize the services of such Persons as the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion may reasonably determine, and all reasonable fees and expenses of any such Persons shall be paid by the Borrowers.
109





14.3    No Liability. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its shareholders, directors, officers or employees nor any other Person assisting them in their duties nor any agent or employee thereof, shall be liable for any waiver, consent or approval given or any action taken, or omitted to be taken, in good faith by it or them hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, or in connection herewith or therewith, or be responsible for the consequences of any oversight or error of judgment whatsoever, except that the Administrative Agent or such other Person, as the case may be, may be liable for losses due to its bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability to any Lender for relying upon, any writing, communication, signature, resolution, representation, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex, electronic mail message, statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. With respect to the Lenders, the Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under any Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action; provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law; provided further that, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action (other than an action expressly required by this Credit Agreement to be taken by it under such circumstances) that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected, as against the Lenders, in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders (or such greater number of Lenders as may be expressly required hereby in any instance) and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders. Except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall have no duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrowers or any of their respective Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrowers or a Lender.
14.4    No Representations.
14.4.1.    General. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the execution or validity or enforceability of this Credit Agreement, the Notes, the Letters of Credit, any of the other Loan Documents or any instrument at any time constituting, or intended to constitute, collateral security for the Notes, or for the value of any such collateral security or for the validity, enforceability or collectability of any such amounts owing with respect to the Notes, or for any recitals or statements, warranties or representations made herein or in any of the other Loan Documents or in any certificate
110





or instrument hereafter furnished to it by or on behalf of any of the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries, or be bound to ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions, covenants or agreements herein or to inspect any of the properties, books or records of any of the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries. The Administrative Agent shall not be bound to ascertain whether any notice, consent, waiver or request delivered to it by any of the Borrowers or any holder of any of the Notes shall have been duly authorized or is true, accurate and complete. The Administrative Agent has not made nor does it now make any representations or warranties, express or implied, nor does it assume any liability to the Lenders, with respect to the credit worthiness or financial conditions of any of the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based upon such information and documents as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Credit Agreement.
14.4.2.    Closing Documentation, Etc. For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions set forth in §11, each Lender that has executed this Credit Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted, or to be satisfied with, each document and matter either sent, or made available, by the Administrative Agent or each Co-Lead Arranger to such Lender for consent, approval, acceptance or satisfaction, or required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to such Lender, unless an officer of the Administrative Agent or each Co-Lead Arranger acting upon any Borrower’s account shall have received notice from such Lender not less than three days prior to the Closing Date specifying such Lender’s objection thereto and such objection shall not have been withdrawn by notice to the Administrative Agent or each Co-Lead Arranger to such effect on or prior to the Closing Date.
14.5    Payments.
14.5.1.    Payments to Administrative Agent. A payment by any of the Borrowers to the Administrative Agent hereunder or any of the other Loan Documents for the account of any Lender shall constitute a payment to such Lender. The Administrative Agent agrees promptly to distribute to each Lender such Lender’s pro rata share of payments received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders except as otherwise expressly provided herein or in any of the other Loan Documents.
14.5.2.    Distribution by Administrative Agent. If in the opinion of the Administrative Agent the distribution of any amount received by it in such capacity hereunder, under the Notes or under any of the other Loan Documents might involve it in liability, it may refrain from making distribution until its right to make distribution shall have been adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction. If a court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge that any amount received and distributed by the Administrative Agent is to be repaid, each Person to whom any such distribution shall have been made shall either repay to the Administrative Agent its proportionate share of the amount so
111





adjudged to be repaid or shall pay over the same in such manner and to such Persons as shall be determined by such court.
14.6    Holders of Notes. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note or the purchaser of any Letter of Credit Participation as the absolute owner or purchaser thereof for all purposes hereof until it shall have been furnished in writing with a different name by such payee or by a subsequent holder, assignee or transferee.
14.7    Indemnity. To the extent not reimbursed by the Borrowers, the Lenders ratably agree hereby to indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates (including any of the officers, directors, employees, agents and attorneys-in-fact of any thereof) (each an “Indemnified Party”) from and against any and all claims, actions and suits (whether groundless or otherwise), losses, damages, costs, expenses (including any expenses for which such Indemnified Party has not been reimbursed by the Borrowers as required by §16.3), and liabilities of every nature and character arising out of or related to this Credit Agreement, the Notes, or any of the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated or evidenced hereby or thereby, or such Indemnified Party’s actions taken hereunder or thereunder, except to the extent that any of the same shall be directly caused by such Indemnified Party’s bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence, or, in the absence of instruction or concurrence of the Required Lenders, breach of contract.
14.8    Administrative Agent as Lender, Etc. In its individual capacity, Bank of America shall have the same obligations and the same rights, powers and privileges in respect to its Commitment and the Loans made by it, and as the holder of any of the Notes and as the purchaser of any Letter of Credit Participations, as it would have were it not also the Administrative Agent. None of the Documentation Agent, Book Runners, Syndication Agents, or Co-Lead Arrangers shall have any obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents other than as a Lender hereunder.
14.9    Resignation.
(a)    The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrowers. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. Provided that no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, such successor Administrative Agent shall be reasonably acceptable to the Borrowers. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; provided that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrowers and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (x) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan
112





Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (y) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and the Issuing Bank directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this §14.9. Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this §14.9). The fees payable by the Borrowers to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrowers and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article 14 and §14.9 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.
(b)    Any resignation by Bank of America as Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section shall also constitute its resignation as Issuing Bank and Swing Line Lender. Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Issuing Bank and Swing Line Lender, (b) the retiring Issuing Bank and Swing Line Lender shall be discharged from all of their respective duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, and (c) the successor Issuing Bank shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to the retiring Issuing Bank to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring Issuing Bank with respect to such Letters of Credit.
14.10    Notification of Defaults and Events of Default. Each Lender hereby agrees that, upon learning of the existence of a Default or an Event of Default, it shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent thereof. The Administrative Agent hereby agrees that upon receipt of any notice under this §14.10 it shall promptly notify the other Lenders of the existence of such Default or Event of Default.
14.11    Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim.
(a)    In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial, administrative or like proceeding or any assignment for the benefit of creditors relative to any of the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries, the Administrative Agent (irrespective
113





of whether the principal of any Loan, Reimbursement Obligation or Unpaid Reimbursement Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on any of the Borrowers) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding, under any such assignment or otherwise:
(i)    to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, Reimbursement Obligations or Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under the terms of this Credit Agreement) allowed in such proceeding or under any such assignment; and
(ii)    to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
(b)    Any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such proceeding or under any such assignment is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, nevertheless to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel due the Administrative Agent under the terms of this Credit Agreement, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under the terms of this Credit Agreement.
(c)    Nothing contained herein shall authorize the Administrative Agent to consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations owed to such Lender or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding or under any such assignment.
15.    ASSIGNMENT AND PARTICIPATION.

15.1    General Conditions and Conditions to Assignment. The provisions of this Credit Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that no Borrower may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of §15.1.1, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of §15.3, or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of §15.6 (and any other
114





attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Credit Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in §15.3 and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Credit Agreement.
15.1.1.    Assignments by Lenders. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans (including for purposes of this subsection (b), participations in Letter of Credit Obligations and in Swing Line Loans) at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions:
(a)    Minimum Amounts.
(i)    in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and
(ii)    in any case not described in §15.1.1(a)(i), the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if “Trade Date” is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, BGI otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that concurrent assignments to members of an Assignee Group and concurrent assignments from members of an Assignee Group to a single Eligible Assignee (or to an Eligible Assignee and members of its Assignee Group) will be treated as a single assignment for purposes of determining whether such minimum amount has been met.
(b)    Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause (b) shall not apply to rights in respect of the Swing Line Lender’s rights and obligations in respect of Swing Line Loans;
115





(c)    Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by §15.1.1(a)(ii) and, in addition:
(i)    the consent of BGI (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) shall be required unless (1) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (2) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; provided that BGI shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment with respect to any Loan unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within ten (10) Business Days after having received notice thereof;
(ii)    the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender;
(iii)    the consent of the Issuing Bank (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for any assignment that increases the obligation of the assignee to participate in exposure under one or more Letters of Credit (whether or not then outstanding); and
(iv)    the consent of the Swing Line Lender (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for any assignment.
(d)    Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment. The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.
(e)    No Assignment to Certain Persons. No such assignment shall be made (A) to BGI or any of BGI’s Subsidiaries, or (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B), or (C) to a natural person (or holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of a natural person).
(f)    Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution
116





thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of BGI and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans in accordance with its Commitment Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Credit Agreement until such compliance occurs.
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to §15.3, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Credit Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Credit Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Credit Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of §§5.6, 5.7, 5.9, 5.12, 16.2 and 16.3 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. Upon request, the Borrowers (at their expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Credit Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Credit Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance §15.3.
15.2    Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers (and such agency being solely for Tax purposes), shall maintain a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register or similar list (the “Register”) for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment Percentage of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to and Letter of Credit Participations purchased by, the Lenders from time to time. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Credit Agreement. In addition, the Administrative Agent shall maintain on the Register information regarding the designation, and revocation of designation, of any Lender as a Defaulting Lender. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers and the Lenders at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
117





15.3    Participations. Each Lender may sell participations to one or more Persons (other than to a Defaulting Lender or a natural person (or holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of a natural person)) (each, a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents; provided that (a) except in the case of any such participation sold to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to a Lender, each such participation shall be in an amount of not less than $5,000,000, or shall be in an amount of such Lender’s entire remaining Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it, (b) any such sale or participation shall not affect the rights and duties of the selling Lender hereunder to the Borrowers, (c) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (d) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Bank shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Credit Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Credit Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver that would reduce the principal of or the interest rate on any Loans subject to such participation, extend the term or increase the amount of the Commitment of such Lender as it relates to such Participant, reduce the amount of any Facility Fee or Letter of Credit Fees or other fees to which such Participant is entitled, or extend any regularly scheduled payment date for principal or interest with respect to Loans subject to such participation. Subject to §15.4, the Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of §§5.6, 5.7, 5.9 and 5.12.1 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to §15.1. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of §16.1 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to §16.1 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrowers’ request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrowers to effectuate the provisions of §5.11 with respect to any Participant. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Credit Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
118





15.4    Limitation upon Participant Rights. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under §§5.6, 5.7 and 5.12.1 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrowers’ prior written consent.
15.5    Participant Affiliated with the Borrowers. If any Lender sells a participating interest in any of the Loans or Reimbursement Obligations to a Participant, and such Participant is any Borrower or an Affiliate of any Borrower, then such transferor Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of the sale of such participation. A transferor Lender shall have no right to vote as a Lender hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents for purposes of granting consents or waivers or for purposes of agreeing to amendments or modifications to any of the Loan Documents or for purposes of making requests to the Administrative Agent pursuant to §13.1 or §13.2 to the extent that such participation is beneficially owned by any Borrower or any Affiliate of any Borrower, and the determination of the Required Lenders shall for all purposes of this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents be made without regard to the interest of such transferor Lender in the Loans or Reimbursement Obligations to the extent of such participation.
15.6    Miscellaneous Assignment Provisions. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its interest and rights under this Credit Agreement (including all or any portion of its Notes) to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation (a) any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to any of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks organized under §4 of the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. §341 and (b) with respect to any Lender that is a fund that invests in bank loans, to any lender or any trustee for, or any other representative of, holders of obligations owed or securities issued by such fund as security for such obligations or securities or any institutional custodian for such fund or for such lender. Any foreclosure or similar action by any Person in respect of such pledge or assignment shall be subject to the other provisions of this §15. No such pledge or the enforcement thereof shall release the pledgor Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, provide any voting rights hereunder to the pledgee thereof, or affect any rights or obligations of the Borrowers or Administrative Agent hereunder.
15.7    Resignation After Assignment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time Bank of America assigns all of its Commitment and Loans pursuant to §15.1, Bank of America may, (i) upon thirty (30) days’ notice to the Borrowers and the Lenders, resign as Issuing Bank and/or (ii) upon thirty (30) days’ notice to the Borrowers, resign as Swing Line Lender. In the event of any such resignation as Issuing Bank or Swing Line Lender, the Borrowers shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor Issuing Bank or Swing Line Lender hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by the Borrowers to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of Bank of America as Issuing Bank or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be. If Bank of America resigns as Issuing Bank, it shall retain all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as Issuing Bank and all Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations plus the Maximum Drawing Amount with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or make payments with
119





respect to Reimbursement Obligations). If Bank of America resigns as Swing Line Lender, it shall retain all the rights of the Swing Line Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swing Line Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swing Line Loans pursuant to §2.9.

In litigation, or the preparation therefor, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to select its own counsel and, in addition to the foregoing indemnity, the Borrowers

If, and to the extent that the obligations of the Borrowers under this §16.3 are unenforceable for any reason, the Borrowers hereby agree to make the maximum contribution to the payment in satisfaction of such obligations which is permissible under applicable law.

16.4.3.    Other.

16.5    Survival of Covenants, Etc. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made herein, in the Notes, in any of the other Loan Documents or in any documents or other papers delivered by or on behalf of any of the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries pursuant hereto shall be deemed to have been relied upon by the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, notwithstanding any investigation heretofore or hereafter made by any of them, and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default, and shall survive the making by the Lenders of any of the Loans and the issuance, extension or renewal of any Letters of Credit, as herein contemplated, and shall continue in full force and effect so long as any Letter of Credit or any amount due under this Credit Agreement or the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents remains outstanding or any

Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other communications sent to an e-mail address shall be deemed received upon the sender’s receipt of an acknowledgement from the intended recipient (such as by the “return receipt requested” function, as available, return e-mail or other written acknowledgement), provided that if such notice or other communication is not sent during the normal business hours of the recipient, such notice or communication shall be deemed to have been sent at the opening of business on the next Business Day for the recipient, and (ii) notices or communications posted to an Internet or intranet website shall be deemed received upon the deemed receipt by the intended recipient at its e-mail address as described in the foregoing clause (i) of notification that such notice or communication is available and identifying the website address therefor.

Any consent or approval required or permitted by this Credit Agreement to be given by the Lenders may be given, and any term of this Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents or any other instrument related hereto or mentioned herein may be amended, and the performance or observance by any of the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries of any terms of this Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents or such other instrument or the continuance of any Default or Event of Default may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively) with, but only with, the written consent of the Borrowers and the written consent of the Required Lenders, and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent (which acknowledgement shall be promptly provided if the Required Lenders have provided consent). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment, modification or waiver shall:
(a)    without the written consent of the Borrowers and each Lender directly affected thereby:
(i)    reduce or forgive the principal amount of any Loans or Reimbursement Obligations, or reduce the rate of interest on the Notes or the amount of the Facility Fee or Letter of Credit Fees or diminish or eliminate indemnity or reimbursement rights in favor of such Lender;
129





(ii)    increase the amount of such Lender’s Commitment or extend the expiration date of such Lender’s Commitment;
(iii)    postpone or extend the Loan Maturity Date or any other regularly scheduled dates for payments of principal of, or interest on, the Loans or Reimbursement Obligations or any Fees or other amounts payable to such Lender, or extend the termination of any Letters of Credit for which such Lender has a Letter of Credit Participation beyond the Loan Maturity Date;
(iv)    (a) amend §14.5.1 or any other provision hereof in a manner that would have the effect of altering the ratable reduction of Commitments or the pro rata sharing of payments otherwise required hereunder, (b) subordinate, or have the effect of subordinating, the Obligations hereunder to any other Indebtedness or other obligation, or (c) release, or have the effect of releasing, all or substantially all of the value of the guarantees of the Obligations;
(b)    without the written consent of all of the Lenders, release any of the Significant Subsidiaries from its guaranty obligations under the Guaranty to which it is a party (it being understood that this limitation shall not apply to any release related to transactions permitted by §9.5), release BGI, Barnes Germany, Barnes Luxembourg or Barnes Switzerland from their guaranty obligations under the BGI Guaranty, Barnes Germany Guaranty, Barnes Luxembourg Guaranty or Barnes Switzerland Guaranty, as the case may be, amend or waive this §16.12 or the definition of Required Lenders (it being understood that the addition of one or more additional credit facilities, the allowance of the credit extensions, interest and fees thereunder to share ratably or on a subordinated basis with the Loans, Letters of Credit, interest and Fees in the benefits of the Loan Documents and the inclusion of the holders of such facilities in the determination of Required Lenders shall require only the approval of the Required Lenders);
(c)    without the written consent of each Lender, amend §1.6 or the definition of “Alternative Currency”; and
(d)    without the written consent of the Administrative Agent, amend or waive §14, the amount or time of payment of the Administrative Agent’s Fee or any Letter of Credit Fees payable for the Administrative Agent’s account or any other provision applicable to the Administrative Agent;
provided, that (i) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by each applicable Issuing Bank in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of such Issuing Bank under this Credit Agreement or any Issuer Document relating to any Letter of Credit issued or to be issued by it; (ii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Swing Line Lender in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of the Swing Line Lender under this Credit Agreement; (iii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent under this Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document.
130





No waiver shall extend to or affect any obligation not expressly waived or impair any right consequent thereon. No course of dealing or delay or omission on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise be prejudicial thereto. No notice to or demand upon the Borrowers shall entitle the Borrowers to other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder (and any amendment, waiver or consent which by its terms requires the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender may be effected with the consent of the applicable Lenders other than Defaulting Lenders), except that (x) the Commitment of any Defaulting Lender may not be increased or extended without the consent of such Lender and (y) any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender that by its terms affects any Defaulting Lender more adversely than other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender.
If a Lender does not consent to a proposed amendment, waiver, consent or release with respect to any Loan Document that requires the consent of such Lender and that has been approved by the Required Lenders, the Borrowers may replace such non-consenting Lender in accordance with § 5.11; provided that such amendment, waiver, consent or release may be effected as a result of the assignment contemplated by such Section (together with all other such assignments required by the Borrowers to be made pursuant to this paragraph).
16.13    Severability. The provisions of this Credit Agreement are severable and if any one clause or provision hereof shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part in any jurisdiction, then such invalidity or unenforceability shall affect only such clause or provision, or part thereof, in such jurisdiction, and shall not in any manner affect such clause or provision in any other jurisdiction, or any other clause or provision of this Credit Agreement in any jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this §16.13, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Credit Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swing Line Lender, as applicable, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited.
16.14    USA Patriot Act Notice. Each Lender and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Borrowers that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the “Patriot Act”), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrowers, which information includes the name and address of the Borrowers and other information that will allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrowers in accordance with the Act.
16.15    Liability for the Obligations.
(a)    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, BGI covenants and agrees that all Obligations with respect to all Loans, Reimbursement Obligations and any
131





other Obligations payable to the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders shall constitute the obligations of BGI individually.
(b)    Notwithstanding any other provision hereof or of any other Loan Document, Barnes Germany shall have no liability for any Obligations other than the Barnes Germany Obligations, or for any other liability or obligation of BGI.
(c)    Notwithstanding any other provision hereof or of any other Loan Document, Barnes Luxembourg shall have no liability for any Obligations other than the Barnes Luxembourg Obligations, or for any other liability or obligation of BGI.
(d)    Notwithstanding any other provision hereof or of any other Loan Document, Barnes Switzerland shall have no liability for any Obligations other than the Barnes Switzerland Obligations, or for any other liability or obligation of BGI.
(e)    The aggregate liability of Barnes Switzerland under any security, guaranty, joint liability, representation, warranty, undertaking, indemnity, parallel debt, postponement and subordination or other obligation incurred in connection with any of the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, the Barnes Switzerland Guaranty) for, or with respect to, obligations of any other Borrower (other than its wholly owned Subsidiaries) shall be limited to the maximum amount of Barnes Switzerland’s freely disposable shareholder equity available for distribution as dividends to the shareholders of Barnes Switzerland at the time of the start of the proceedings for enforcement of the relevant obligation, which amount: (i) shall be determined in accordance with Swiss law and on the basis of an audited annual or interim balance sheet of Barnes Switzerland; (ii) shall be approved as distribution by a duly convened meeting of the shareholders of Barnes Switzerland; and (iii) shall be subject to deduction of any applicable Swiss withholding tax.
16.16    Judgment Currency. If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other Loan Document in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of each Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the “Judgment Currency”) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Credit Agreement (the “Agreement Currency”), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent from any Borrower in the Agreement Currency, such Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or the Person to whom such obligation was owing against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the
132





Administrative Agent in such currency, the Administrative Agent agrees to return the amount of any excess to such Borrower (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable law).
16.17    Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial Institutions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Lender that is an Affected Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the write-down and conversion powers of the Applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:
(a)    the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the Applicable Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any Lender that is an Affected Financial Institution; and
(b)    the effects of any Bail-in Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:
(i)    a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;
(ii)    a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such Affected Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document; or
(iii)    the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of the Applicable Resolution Authority.
16.18    Acknowledgment Regarding Any Supported QFCs. To the extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for any Hedge Agreement or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, “QFC Credit Support”, and each such QFC, a “Supported QFC”), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the “U.S. Special Resolution Regimes”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States):
(a)    In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “Covered Party”) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution
133





Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.
(b)    As used in this §16.18, the following terms have the following meanings:
“BHC Act Affiliate” of a party means an “affiliate” (as such term is defined under, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 1841(k)) of such party.
“Covered Entity” means any of the following: (i) a “covered entity” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 252.82(b); (ii) a “covered bank” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 47.3(b); or (iii) a “covered FSI” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 382.2(b).
“Default Right” has the meaning assigned to that term in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. §§ 252.81, 47.2 or 382.1, as applicable.
“QFC” has the meaning assigned to the term “qualified financial contract” in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 5390(c)(8)(D).
17.    TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS.

17.1    Existing Credit Agreement Superseded. This Credit Agreement shall on the Closing Date amend, restate, and supersede the Existing Credit Agreement in its entirety, except as provided in this §17. On the Closing Date, the rights and obligations of the parties evidenced by the Existing Credit Agreement shall be evidenced by this Credit Agreement. All “Obligations” (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) shall continue to be outstanding except as expressly modified by this Credit Agreement and any other applicable Loan Documents and shall be governed in all respects by this Credit Agreement and the other Loan
134





Documents, it being agreed and understood that this Credit Agreement represents a modification of, and does not constitute a novation, satisfaction, payment or reborrowing of any Obligation (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement), nor does it operate as a waiver of any right, power or remedy of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender under any “Loan Documents” (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement).
17.2    Return or Cancellation of Notes. Upon receipt by any Lender of its Notes hereunder on the Closing Date, any “Notes” of the Borrowers held by such Lender pursuant to and as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement shall be deemed to be no longer effective. As soon as practicable after its receipt of original Notes hereunder following the Closing Date, each Lender will use commercially reasonable efforts to return or mark as “Substituted” or “Cancelled”, as the case may be, any notes of the Borrowers held by such Lender pursuant to the Existing Credit Agreement.
17.3    Fees Under Superseded Agreement. Commencing on the Closing Date and all periods going forward, the Facility Fee shall be payable by the Borrowers to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders in accordance with §2.2.
18.    NO ADVISORY OR FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY.

In connection with all aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document), each Borrower and each other Loan Party acknowledges and agrees, and acknowledges its Affiliates’ understanding, that: (i) (A) the arranging and other services regarding this Credit Agreement provided by the Administrative Agent, each Co-Lead Arranger and each Lender, are arm’s-length commercial transactions between the Borrowers, each other Loan Party and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, each Co-Lead Arranger and each Lender, on the other hand, (B) each of the Borrowers and the other Loan Parties has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate, and (C) each Borrower and each other Loan Party is capable of evaluating, and understands and accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents; (ii) (A) the Administrative Agent, each Co-Lead Arranger and each Lender each is and has been acting solely as a principal and, except as expressly agreed in writing by the relevant parties, has not been, is not, and will not be acting as an advisor, agent or fiduciary for the Borrowers, any other Loan Party or any of their respective Affiliates, or any other Person and (B) neither the Administrative Agent, nor each Co-Lead Arranger and Lender has any obligation to the Borrowers, any other Loan Party or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents; and (iii) the Administrative Agent, each Co-Lead Arranger and each Lender and their respective Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Borrowers, the other Loan Parties and their respective Affiliates, and neither the Administrative Agent nor any Co-Lead Arranger has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to the Borrowers, any other Loan Party or any of their respective Affiliates. To the fullest extent permitted by law, each of the Borrowers and the other Loan Parties hereby waives
135





and releases any claims that it may have against the Administrative Agent, each Co-Lead Arranger and each Lender with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect of any transaction contemplated hereby.

(b) interest on the principal balance hereof from time to time outstanding from the Closing Date under the Credit Agreement through and including the maturity date hereof at the times and at the rate provided in the Credit Agreement;
provided, that any payments hereunder are subject to §§3 and 16.15 of the Credit Agreement.
[This [_____] Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Note (this “Note”) constitutes the amendment and restatement in its entirety of the [_____] Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Note, dated as of [_____], issued by the Borrower to the Lender in the principal amount of [$______] (the “Prior Note”), and is in substitution therefor and an amendment and replacement thereof. Nothing herein shall be construed to constitute a novation or payment of the Prior Note or to release or terminate any guaranty or lien, mortgage, pledge or other security entered in favor of the Administrative Agent, the Lender, or any other Lender under the Credit Agreement.]******
This Note evidences borrowings under and has been issued by the Borrower in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. The Lender and any holder hereof is entitled to the benefits of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and may enforce the agreements of the Borrower contained therein, and any holder hereof may exercise the respective remedies provided for thereby or otherwise available in respect thereof, all in accordance with the

The Borrower irrevocably authorizes the Lender to make or cause to be made, at or about the time of the Drawdown Date of any Revolving Credit Loan or at the time of receipt of any payment of principal of this Note, an appropriate notation on the grid attached to this Note, or the continuation of such grid, or any other similar record, including computer records, reflecting the making of such Revolving Credit Loan or (as the case may be) the receipt of such payment. The outstanding amount of the Revolving Credit Loans set forth on the grid attached to this Note, or the continuation of such grid, or any other similar record, including computer records, maintained by the Lender with respect to any Revolving Credit Loans shall be prima facie evidence of the principal amount thereof owing and unpaid to the Lender, but the failure to record, or any error in so recording, any such amount on any such grid, continuation or other record shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under the Credit Agreement to make payments of principal of and interest on this Note when due.
The Borrower has the right in certain circumstances and the obligation under certain other circumstances to prepay the whole or part of the principal of this Note on the terms and conditions specified in the Credit Agreement.
If any one or more of the Events of Default shall occur, the entire unpaid principal amount of this Note and all of the unpaid interest accrued thereon may become or be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Credit Agreement.
No delay or omission on the part of the Lender or any holder hereof in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver of such right or of any other rights of the Lender or such holder, nor shall any delay, omission or waiver on any one occasion be deemed a bar or waiver of the same or any other right on any further occasion.
The Borrower and every endorser and guarantor of this Note or the obligation represented hereby waives presentment, demand, notice, protest and all other demands and notices in connection with the delivery, acceptance, performance, default or enforcement of this Note, and assents to any extension or postponement of the time of payment or any other indulgence, to any substitution, exchange or release of collateral and to the addition or release of any other party or person primarily or secondarily liable.
THIS NOTE AND THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE BORROWER HEREUNDER SHALL, PURSUANT TO NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW §5-1401, BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. THE BORROWER CONSENTS AND AGREES THAT ANY SUIT FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF THIS NOTE MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK OR ANY FEDERAL COURT SITTING THEREIN AND CONSENTS TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURT AND THE SERVICE OF PROCESS IN ANY SUCH SUIT BEING MADE UPON THE BORROWER BY MAIL AT THE ADDRESS SPECIFIED IN §16.6 OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE BORROWER HEREBY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION THAT IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT OR ANY SUCH COURT OR THAT SUCH SUIT IS BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT COURT.

The Guarantor waives promptness, diligences, presentment, demand, protest, notice of acceptance, notice of any Obligations incurred and all other notices of any kind, all defenses which may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium law or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, any right to require the marshalling of assets of any Company or any other entity or other person primarily or secondarily liable with respect to any of the Obligations, and all suretyship defenses generally. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Guarantor agrees to the provisions of any instrument evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any Obligation and agrees that the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the failure of the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Company or any other entity or other person primarily or secondarily liable with respect to any of the Obligations; (ii) any extensions, compromise, refinancing, consolidation or renewals of any Obligation; (iii) any change in the time, place or manner of payment of any of the Obligations or any rescissions, waivers, compromise, refinancing, consolidation or other amendments or modifications of any of the terms or provisions of the Credit Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents or any other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any of the Obligations; (iv) the addition, substitution or release of any entity or other person primarily or secondarily liable for any Obligation; (v) the adequacy of any rights which the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party may have against any collateral security or other means of obtaining repayment of

any of the Obligations; (vi) the impairment of any collateral securing any of the Obligations, including without limitation the failure to perfect or preserve any rights which the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party might have in such collateral security or the substitution, exchange, surrender, release, loss or destruction of any such collateral security; or (vii) any other act or omission which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Guarantor or otherwise operate as a release or discharge of the Guarantor, all of which may be done without notice to the Guarantor. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Guarantor hereby expressly waives any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of (A) any “one action” or “anti-deficiency” law which would otherwise prevent the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party from bringing any action, including any claim for a deficiency, or exercising any other right or remedy (including any right of set-off), against the Guarantor before or after the Administrative Agent’s or such other Credit Party’s commencement or completion of any foreclosure action, whether judicially, by exercise of power of sale or otherwise, or (B) any other law which in any other way would otherwise require any election of remedies by the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party.
5.Unenforceability of Obligations Against Companies.

If for any reason Barnes Germany or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the “Barnes Germany Companies”) has no legal existence or is under no legal obligation to discharge any of the Barnes Germany Obligations, or if any of the Barnes Germany Obligations have become irrecoverable from any Barnes Germany Company by reason of such Barnes Germany Company’s insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization or by other operation of law or for any other reason, this Guaranty shall nevertheless be binding on the Guarantor to the same extent as if the Guarantor at all times had been the principal obligor on all such Barnes Germany Obligations. In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Barnes Germany Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of a Barnes Germany Company, or for any other reason, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents or any other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any Barnes Germany Obligation shall be immediately due and payable by the Guarantor.

In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Barnes Luxembourg Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of a Barnes Luxembourg Company, or for any other reason, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents or any other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any Barnes Luxembourg Obligation shall be immediately due and payable by the Guarantor.
5.3    Unenforceability of Barnes Switzerland Obligations Against Barnes Switzerland.

- 4 -
irrecoverable from any Barnes Switzerland Company by reason of such Barnes Switzerland Company’s insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization or by other operation of law or for any other reason, this Guaranty shall nevertheless be binding on the Guarantor to the same extent as if the Guarantor at all times had been the principal obligor on all such Barnes Switzerland Obligations. In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Barnes Switzerland Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of a Barnes Switzerland Company, or for any other reason, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents or any other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any Barnes Switzerland Obligation shall be immediately due and payable by the Guarantor.
5.4.    If for any reason any of the Guarantor’s or BGI’s Subsdiaries other than the Barnes Germany Companies, the Barnes Luxembourg Companies or the Barnes Switzerland Companies has no legal existence or is under no legal obligation to discharge any of the Obligations, or if any of the Obligations have become irrecoverable from such a Company by reason of such Company’s insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization or by other operation of law or for any other reason, this Guaranty shall nevertheless be binding on the Guarantor to the same extent as if the Guarantor at all times had been the principal obligor on all such Obligations. In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of such a Company, or for any other reason, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents or any other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any Obligation shall be immediately due and payable by the Guarantor.
6.Subrogation; Subordination.
6.1.     Waiver of Rights Against Each Company. Until the final payment and performance in full of all of the Obligations, the Guarantor shall not exercise and hereby waives any rights against each Company arising as a result of payment by the Guarantor hereunder, by way of subrogation, reimbursement, restitution, contribution or otherwise, and will not prove any claim in competition with the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party in respect of any payment hereunder in any bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization case or proceedings of any nature; the Guarantor will not claim any setoff, recoupment or counterclaim against any Company in respect of any liability of the Guarantor to such Company; and the Guarantor waives any benefit of and any right to participate in any collateral security which may be held by the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party.
6.2.    Subordination. The payment of any amounts due with respect to any indebtedness of each Company for money borrowed or credit received now or hereafter owed to the Guarantor is hereby subordinated to the prior payment in full of all of the Obligations. The Guarantor agrees that, while any default in the payment or performance of any of the Obligations exists, the Guarantor will not demand, sue for or otherwise attempt to collect any such indebtedness of any Company to the Guarantor until all of the Obligations shall have been paid in full or such default ceases to exist. If, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Guarantor shall collect, enforce or receive any amounts in respect of such indebtedness while any Obligations are still outstanding, such amounts shall be collected, enforced and received by the Guarantor as trustee for the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties and be paid over to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties, on account of the Obligations without affecting in any manner the liability of the Guarantor under the other provisions of this Guaranty.

- 5 -
6.3.    Provisions Supplemental. The provisions of this §6 shall be supplemental to and not in derogation of any rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties under any separate subordination agreement which the Administrative Agent may at any time and from time to time enter into with the Guarantor for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties.
7.Setoff. Regardless of the adequacy of any collateral security or other means of obtaining payment of any of the Obligations, each of the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, without notice to the Guarantor (any such notice being expressly waived by the Guarantor) and to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply such deposits and other sums against the obligations of the Guarantor under this Guaranty, whether or not the Administrative Agent or such other Credit Party shall have made any demand under this Guaranty and although such obligations may be contingent or unmatured.
8.Further Assurances. The Guarantor agrees that it will from time to time, at the request of the Administrative Agent, do all such things and execute all such documents as the Administrative Agent may consider necessary or desirable to give full effect to this Guaranty and to perfect and preserve the rights and powers of the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties hereunder. The Guarantor acknowledges and confirms that the Guarantor itself has established its own adequate means of obtaining from each Company on a continuing basis all information desired by the Guarantor concerning the financial condition of such Company and that the Guarantor will look to such Company and not to the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party in order for the Guarantor to keep adequately informed of changes in such Company’s financial condition.
9.Termination; Reinstatement. This Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect until the Administrative Agent is given written notice of the Guarantor’s intention to discontinue this Guaranty, notwithstanding any intermediate or temporary payment or settlement of the whole or any part of the Obligations. No such notice shall be effective unless received and acknowledged by an officer of the Administrative Agent at the address of the Administrative Agent for notices set forth in §16.6 of the Credit Agreement. No such notice shall affect any rights of the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party hereunder, including without limitation the rights set forth in §§4 and 6, with respect to any Obligations incurred or accrued prior to the receipt of such notice or any Obligations incurred or accrued pursuant to any contract or commitment in existence prior to such receipt. This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, notwithstanding any such notice, if at any time any payment made or value received with respect to any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Company, or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made or value received.
10.Successors and Assigns. This Guaranty shall be binding upon the Guarantor, its successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties and their respective successors, transferees and assigns. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, each Credit Party may assign or otherwise transfer the Credit Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents or any other agreement or note held by it evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with the Obligations, or sell participations in any interest therein, to any other entity or other person, and such other entity or other person shall thereupon become vested, to the extent set forth in the agreement evidencing such assignment, transfer or participation, with all the rights in

- 6 -
respect thereof granted to such Credit Party herein, all in accordance with §15 of the Credit Agreement. The Guarantor may not assign any of its obligations hereunder.
11.Joinder Agreement and Affirmation. To the extent requested by the Administrative Agent, the Guarantor will cause each Subsidiary [(excluding any foreign Subsidiaries)] of the Guarantor to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties, (a) a Joinder Agreement and Affirmation in the form of Annex I attached hereto, and (b) any other instruments and documents as the Administrative Agent may reasonably require, together with legal opinions in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent to be delivered to the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties opining as to authorization, validity and enforceability of such Guaranty.
12.Amendments and Waivers. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Guaranty nor consent to any departure by the Guarantor therefrom shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders. No failure on the part of the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right.
13.Notices. All notices and other communications called for hereunder shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise specifically provided herein, shall be deemed to have been duly made or given when delivered by hand or mailed first class, postage prepaid, or, in the case of telegraphic or telexed notice, when transmitted, answer back received, addressed as follows: if to the Guarantor, at the address set forth beneath its signature hereto, and if to the Administrative Agent, at the address for notices to the Administrative Agent set forth in §16.6 of the Credit Agreement, or at such address as either party may designate in writing to the other.
14.Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction. THIS GUARANTY SHALL, PURSUANT TO NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW §5-1401, BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. The Guarantor agrees that any suit for the enforcement of this Guaranty may be brought in the courts of the State of New York or any federal court sitting therein and consents to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of such court and to service of process in any such suit being made upon the Guarantor by mail at the address specified by reference in §13. The Guarantor hereby waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such suit or any such court or that such suit was brought in an inconvenient court.
15.Waiver of Jury Trial. THE GUARANTOR AND EACH OF THE BENEFICIARIES OF THIS GUARANTY HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF ANY DISPUTE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS GUARANTY, ANY RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER OR THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY OF SUCH RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS. Except as prohibited by law, the Guarantor hereby waives any right which it may have to claim or recover in any litigation referred to in the preceding sentence any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages or any damages other than, or in addition to, actual damages. The Guarantor (i) certifies that neither the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party nor any representative, agent or attorney of the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party would not, in

- 7 -
the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waivers and (ii) acknowledges that, in entering into the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party is a party, the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties are relying upon, among other things, the waivers and certifications contained in this §15.

4.Waivers by Guarantor; Bank’s Freedom to Act. The Guarantor agrees that the Obligations will be paid and performed strictly in accordance with their respective terms, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party with respect thereto. The Guarantor waives promptness, diligences, presentment, demand, protest, notice of acceptance, notice of any Obligations incurred and all other notices of any kind, all defenses which may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium law or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, any right to require the marshalling of assets of any Company or any other entity or other person primarily or secondarily liable with respect to any of the Obligations, and all suretyship defenses generally. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Guarantor agrees to the provisions of any instrument evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any Obligation and agrees that the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the failure of the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any



- 3 -
right or remedy against any Company or any other entity or other person primarily or secondarily liable with respect to any of the Obligations; (ii) any extensions, compromise, refinancing, consolidation or renewals of any Obligation; (iii) any change in the time, place or manner of payment of any of the Obligations or any rescissions, waivers, compromise, refinancing, consolidation or other amendments or modifications of any of the terms or provisions of the Credit Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents or any other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any of the Obligations; (iv) the addition, substitution or release of any entity or other person primarily or secondarily liable for any Obligation; (v) the adequacy of any rights which the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party may have against any collateral security or other means of obtaining repayment of any of the Obligations; (vi) the impairment of any collateral securing any of the Obligations, including without limitation the failure to perfect or preserve any rights which the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party might have in such collateral security or the substitution, exchange, surrender, release, loss or destruction of any such collateral security; or (vii) any other act or omission which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Guarantor or otherwise operate as a release or discharge of the Guarantor, all of which may be done without notice to the Guarantor. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Guarantor hereby expressly waives any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of (A) any “one action” or “anti-deficiency” law which would otherwise prevent the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party from bringing any action, including any claim for a deficiency, or exercising any other right or remedy (including any right of set-off), against the Guarantor before or after the Administrative Agent’s or such Credit Party’s commencement or completion of any foreclosure action, whether judicially, by exercise of power of sale or otherwise, or (B) any other law which in any other way would otherwise require any election of remedies by the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party.

8.Further Assurances. The Guarantor agrees that it will from time to time, at the request of the Administrative Agent, do all such things and execute all such documents as the Administrative Agent may consider necessary or desirable to give full effect to this BGI Guaranty and to perfect and preserve the rights and powers of the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties hereunder. The Guarantor acknowledges and confirms that the Guarantor itself has established its own adequate means of obtaining from each Company on a continuing basis all information desired by the Guarantor concerning the financial condition of such Company and that the Guarantor will look to such Company and not to the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party in order for the Guarantor to keep adequately informed of changes in such Company’s financial condition.
9.Termination; Reinstatement. This BGI Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect until the Administrative Agent is given written notice of the Guarantor’s intention to discontinue this BGI Guaranty, notwithstanding any intermediate or temporary payment or settlement of the whole or any part of the Obligations. No such notice shall be effective unless received and acknowledged by an officer of the Administrative Agent at the address of the Administrative Agent for notices set forth in §16.6 of the Credit Agreement.

This BGI Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, notwithstanding any such notice, if at any time any payment made or value received with respect to any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Company, or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made or value received.

THE GUARANTOR AND EACH OF THE BENEFICIARIES OF THIS BGI GUARANTY HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF ANY DISPUTE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS BGI GUARANTY, ANY RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER OR THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY OF SUCH RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS. Except as prohibited by law, the Guarantor hereby waives any right which it may have to claim or recover in any litigation referred to in the preceding sentence any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages or any damages other than, or in addition to, actual damages. The Guarantor (i) certifies that neither the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party nor any representative, agent or attorney of the

15.Miscellaneous. This BGI Guaranty constitutes the entire agreement of the Guarantor with respect to the matters set forth herein. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law or any other agreement, and this BGI Guaranty shall be in addition to any other guaranty of or collateral security for any of the Obligations. The invalidity or unenforceability of any one or more sections of this BGI Guaranty shall not affect the validity or enforceability of its remaining provisions.

This SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED BARNES LUXEMBOURG GUARANTY, dated as of February 10, 2021 (this “Barnes Luxembourg Guaranty”), is made by BARNES GROUP LUXEMBOURG (NO. 1) S.À R.L., a private limited company organized under the laws of Luxembourg (“Barnes Luxembourg” or the “Guarantor”) in favor of BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., as administrative agent under the Credit Agreement referred to below (hereinafter, in such capacity, the “Administrative Agent”) for the benefit of itself and the other Credit Parties.
RECITALS
WHEREAS, reference is made to that certain Sixth Amended and Restated Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of February 10, 2021 (as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”), by and among Barnes Group Inc., a Delaware corporation, Barnes Group Acquisition GmbH, a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Germany (“Barnes Germany”), Barnes Luxembourg and Barnes Switzerland GmbH, a limited liability company organized under the laws of Switzerland, acting through its Nevis Branch (“Barnes Switzerland” and, together with Barnes Germany, each of their Subsidiaries and the Subsidiaries of Barnes Luxembourg, each a “Company” and, collectively the “Companies”), the Lenders party thereto from time to time and the Administrative Agent;
WHEREAS, pursuant to the Existing Credit Agreement, the Guarantor entered into that certain Amended and Restated Barnes Luxembourg Guaranty, dated as of September 27, 2013 (the “Existing Barnes Luxembourg Guaranty”), in favor of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders;
WHEREAS, the Guarantor, the Companies, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders wish that the provisions of the Existing Credit Agreement be amended and restated pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement and are, contemporaneously herewith, entering into the Credit Agreement;
WHEREAS, it is a condition precedent to the effectiveness of the Credit Agreement that the Guarantor execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent this Barnes Luxembourg Guaranty;
WHEREAS, the Companies and the Guarantor are members of a group of related corporations, the success of any one of which is dependent in part on the success of the other members of such group;
WHEREAS, the Guarantor expects to receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the extensions of credit to the Companies by the Lenders pursuant to the Credit Agreement (which benefits are hereby acknowledged); and

DB3/ 203698062.3



2.Guaranty of Payment and Performance. The Guarantor hereby guarantees to the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties the full and punctual payment when due (whether at stated maturity, by required pre-payment, by acceleration or otherwise), as well as the performance, of all of the (i) Barnes Germany Obligations and the Barnes Switzerland Obligations, (ii) Obligations owing to a Credit Party in respect of Specified Hedge Agreements and Cash Management Agreements by any of the Guarantor or the Companies, and (iii) all such which would become due but for the operation of the automatic stay pursuant to § 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code of the United States and the operation of §§ 502(b) and 506(b) of the Bankruptcy Code of the United States (all such Obligations, collectively, the “Guaranteed Obligations”). This Barnes Luxembourg Guaranty is an absolute, unconditional and continuing guaranty of the full and punctual payment and performance of all of the Guaranteed Obligations and not of their collectibility only and is in no way conditioned upon any requirement that the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party first attempt to collect any of the Guaranteed Obligations from any Company or resort to any collateral security or other means of obtaining payment. Should any Company default in the payment or performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder with respect to such Guaranteed Obligations in default shall, upon demand by the Administrative Agent, become immediately due and payable to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties, without demand or notice of any nature, all of which are expressly waived by the Guarantor. Payments by the Guarantor hereunder may be required by the Administrative Agent on any number of occasions. All payments by the Guarantor hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, in the manner and at the place of payment specified therefor in the Credit Agreement, for the account of the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties.
3.Guarantor’s Agreement to Pay Enforcement Costs, etc. The Guarantor further agrees, as the principal obligor and not as a guarantor only, to pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, in Dollars, all costs and expenses (including court costs and legal expenses) incurred or expended by the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations, this Barnes Luxembourg Guaranty and the enforcement thereof, together with interest on amounts recoverable under this §3 from the time when such amounts become due until payment, whether before or after judgment, at the rate of interest for overdue principal set forth in the Credit Agreement, provided that if such interest exceeds the maximum amount permitted to be paid under applicable law, then such interest shall be reduced to such maximum permitted amount.
4.Waivers by Guarantor; Bank’s Freedom to Act. The Guarantor agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid and performed strictly in accordance with their respective terms, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party with respect thereto. The Guarantor waives promptness, diligences, presentment, demand, protest, notice of acceptance, notice of any Guaranteed Obligations incurred and all other notices of any kind, all defenses which may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium law or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, any right to require the marshalling of assets of any Company or any other entity or other person primarily or secondarily liable with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations, and all suretyship defenses generally. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Guarantor agrees to the provisions of any instrument evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any Guaranteed Obligation and agrees that the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the failure of the Administrative Agent or any



other Credit Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Company or any other entity or other person primarily or secondarily liable with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (ii) any extensions, compromise, refinancing, consolidation or renewals of any Guaranteed Obligation; (iii) any change in the time, place or manner of payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any rescissions, waivers, compromise, refinancing, consolidation or other amendments or modifications of any of the terms or provisions of the Credit Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents or any other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (iv) the addition, substitution or release of any entity or other person primarily or secondarily liable for any Guaranteed Obligation; (v) the adequacy of any rights which the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party may have against any collateral security or other means of obtaining repayment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (vi) the impairment of any collateral securing any of the Guaranteed Obligations, including without limitation the failure to perfect or preserve any rights which the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party might have in such collateral security or the substitution, exchange, surrender, release, loss or destruction of any such collateral security; or (vii) any other act or omission which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Guarantor or otherwise operate as a release or discharge of the Guarantor, all of which may be done without notice to the Guarantor. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Guarantor hereby expressly waives any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of (A) any “one action” or “anti-deficiency” law which would otherwise prevent the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party from bringing any action, including any claim for a deficiency, or exercising any other right or remedy (including any right of set-off), against the Guarantor before or after the Administrative Agent’s or such other Credit Party’s commencement or completion of any foreclosure action, whether judicially, by exercise of power of sale or otherwise, or (B) any other law which in any other way would otherwise require any election of remedies by the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party.
5.Unenforceability of Obligations Against Companies.
5.1.    Unenforceability of Barnes Germany Obligations Against Barnes Germany. If for any reason Barnes Germany or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the “Barnes Germany Companies”) has no legal existence or is under no legal obligation to discharge any of the Barnes Germany Obligations, or if any of the Barnes Germany Obligations have become irrecoverable from any Barnes Germany Company by reason of such Barnes Germany Company’s insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization or by other operation of law or for any other reason, this Barnes Luxembourg Guaranty shall nevertheless be binding on the Guarantor to the same extent as if the Guarantor at all times had been the principal obligor on all such Barnes Germany Obligations. In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Barnes Germany Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of a Barnes Germany Company, or for any other reason, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents or any other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any Barnes Germany Obligation shall be immediately due and payable by the Guarantor.
5.2.    Unenforceability of Barnes Switzerland Obligations Against Barnes Switzerland. If for any reason Barnes Switzerland or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the “Barnes Switzerland Companies”) has no legal existence or is under no legal obligation to discharge any of the Barnes Switzerland Obligations, or if any of the Barnes Switzerland Obligations have become irrecoverable from any Barnes Germany Company by reason of such Barnes Germany Company’s insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization or by other operation of law or for any other reason, this Barnes



Luxembourg Guaranty shall nevertheless be binding on the Guarantor to the same extent as if the Guarantor at all times had been the principal obligor on all such Barnes Switzerland Obligations. In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Barnes Switzerland Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of a Barnes Germany Company, or for any other reason, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents or any other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any Barnes Switzerland Obligation shall be immediately due and payable by the Guarantor.
6.Subrogation; Subordination.
6.1.    Waiver of Rights Against Each Company. Until the final payment and performance in full of all of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Guarantor shall not exercise and hereby waives any rights against each Company arising as a result of payment by the Guarantor hereunder, by way of subrogation, reimbursement, restitution, contribution or otherwise, and will not prove any claim in competition with the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party in respect of any payment hereunder in any bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization case or proceedings of any nature; the Guarantor will not claim any setoff, recoupment or counterclaim against any Company in respect of any liability of the Guarantor to such Company; and the Guarantor waives any benefit of and any right to participate in any collateral security which may be held by the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party.
6.2.    Subordination. The payment of any amounts due with respect to any indebtedness of each Company for money borrowed or credit received now or hereafter owed to the Guarantor is hereby subordinated to the prior payment in full of all of the Guaranteed Obligations. The Guarantor agrees that, while any default in the payment or performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations exists, the Guarantor will not demand, sue for or otherwise attempt to collect any such indebtedness of any Company to the Guarantor until all of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been paid in full or such default ceases to exist. If, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Guarantor shall collect, enforce or receive any amounts in respect of such indebtedness while any Guaranteed Obligations are still outstanding, such amounts shall be collected, enforced and received by the Guarantor as trustee for the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties and be paid over to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties, on account of the Guaranteed Obligations, as the case may be, without affecting in any manner the liability of the Guarantor under the other provisions of this Barnes Luxembourg Guaranty.
6.3.    Provisions Supplemental. The provisions of this §6 shall be supplemental to and not in derogation of any rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties under any separate subordination agreement which the Administrative Agent may at any time and from time to time enter into with the Guarantor for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties.
7.Setoff. Regardless of the adequacy of any collateral security or other means of obtaining payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, each of the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, without notice to the Guarantor (any such notice being expressly waived by the Guarantor) and to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply such deposits and other sums against the obligations of the Guarantor under this Barnes Luxembourg Guaranty, whether or not the Administrative Agent or such Credit Party shall have made any demand under this Barnes Luxembourg Guaranty and although such obligations may be contingent or unmatured.



8.Further Assurances. The Guarantor agrees that it will from time to time, at the request of the Administrative Agent, do all such things and execute all such documents as the Administrative Agent may consider necessary or desirable to give full effect to this Barnes Luxembourg Guaranty and to perfect and preserve the rights and powers of the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties hereunder. The Guarantor acknowledges and confirms that the Guarantor itself has established its own adequate means of obtaining from each Company on a continuing basis all information desired by the Guarantor concerning the financial condition of such Company and that the Guarantor will look to such Company and not to the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party in order for the Guarantor to keep adequately informed of changes in such Company’s financial condition.
9.Termination; Reinstatement. This Barnes Luxembourg Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect until the Administrative Agent is given written notice of the Guarantor’s intention to discontinue this Barnes Luxembourg Guaranty, notwithstanding any intermediate or temporary payment or settlement of the whole or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations. No such notice shall be effective unless received and acknowledged by an officer of the Administrative Agent at the address of the Administrative Agent for notices set forth in §16.6 of the Credit Agreement. No such notice shall affect any rights of the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party hereunder, including without limitation the rights set forth in §§4 and 6, with respect to any Guaranteed Obligations incurred or accrued prior to the receipt of such notice or any Guaranteed Obligations incurred or accrued pursuant to any contract or commitment in existence prior to such receipt. This Barnes Luxembourg Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, notwithstanding any such notice, if at any time any payment made or value received with respect to any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Company, or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made or value received.
10.Successors and Assigns. This Barnes Luxembourg Guaranty shall be binding upon the Guarantor, its successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties and their respective successors, transferees and assigns. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, each Credit Party may assign or otherwise transfer the Credit Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents or any other agreement or note held by it evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations, or sell participations in any interest therein, to any other entity or other person, and such other entity or other person shall thereupon become vested, to the extent set forth in the agreement evidencing such assignment, transfer or participation, with all the rights in respect thereof granted to such Credit Party herein, all in accordance with §15 of the Credit Agreement. The Guarantor may not assign any of its obligations hereunder.
11.Amendments and Waivers. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Barnes Luxembourg Guaranty nor consent to any departure by the Guarantor therefrom shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders. No failure on the part of the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right.



12.Notices. All notices and other communications called for hereunder shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise specifically provided herein, shall be deemed to have been duly made or given when delivered by hand or mailed first class, postage prepaid, or, in the case of telegraphic or telexed notice, when transmitted, answer back received, addressed as follows: if to the Guarantor, at the address set forth beneath its signature hereto, and if to the Administrative Agent, at the address for notices to the Administrative Agent set forth in §16.6 of the Credit Agreement, or at such address as either party may designate in writing to the other.
13.Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction. THIS BARNES LUXEMBOURG GUARANTY SHALL, PURSUANT TO NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW §5-1401, BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

The Guarantor hereby waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such suit or any such court or that such suit was brought in an inconvenient court.
14.Waiver of Jury Trial. THE GUARANTOR AND EACH OF THE BENEFICIARIES OF THIS BARNES LUXEMBOURG GUARANTY HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF ANY DISPUTE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS BARNES LUXEMBOURG GUARANTY, ANY RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER OR THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY OF SUCH RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS. Except as prohibited by law, the Guarantor hereby waives any right which it may have to claim or recover in any litigation referred to in the preceding sentence any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages or any damages other than, or in addition to, actual damages. The Guarantor (i) certifies that neither the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party nor any representative, agent or attorney of the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waivers and (ii) acknowledges that, in entering into the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party is a party, the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties are relying upon, among other things, the waivers and certifications contained in this §14.

defenses generally. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Guarantor agrees to the provisions of any instrument evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any Guaranteed Obligation and agrees that the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the failure of the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Company or any other entity or other person primarily or secondarily liable with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (ii) any extensions, compromise, refinancing, consolidation or renewals of any Guaranteed Obligation; (iii) any change in the time, place or manner of payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any rescissions, waivers, compromise, refinancing, consolidation or other amendments or modifications of any of the terms or provisions of the Credit Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents or any other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (iv) the addition, substitution or release of any entity or other person primarily or secondarily liable for any Guaranteed Obligation; (v) the adequacy of any rights which the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party may have against any collateral security or other means of obtaining repayment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (vi) the impairment of any collateral securing any of the Guaranteed Obligations, including without limitation the failure to perfect or preserve any rights which the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party might have in such collateral security or the substitution, exchange, surrender, release, loss or destruction of any such collateral security; or (vii) any other act or omission which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Guarantor or otherwise operate as a release or discharge of the Guarantor, all of which may be done without notice to the Guarantor. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Guarantor hereby expressly waives any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of (A) any “one action” or “anti-deficiency” law which would otherwise prevent the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party from bringing any action, including any claim for a deficiency, or exercising any other right or remedy (including any right of set-off), against the Guarantor before or after the Administrative Agent’s or such other Credit Party’s commencement or completion of any foreclosure action, whether judicially, by exercise of power of sale or otherwise, or (B) any other law which in any other way would otherwise require any election of remedies by the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party.
5.Unenforceability of Obligations Against Companies.
5.1.    Unenforceability of Barnes Germany Obligations Against Barnes Germany. If for any reason Barnes Germany or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the “Barnes Germany Companies”) has no legal existence or is under no legal obligation to discharge any of the Barnes Germany Obligations, or if any of the Barnes Germany Obligations have become irrecoverable from any Barnes Germany Company by reason of such Barnes Germany Company’s insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization or by other operation of law or for any other reason, this Barnes Switzerland Guaranty shall nevertheless be binding on the Guarantor to the same extent as if the Guarantor at all times had been the principal obligor on all such Barnes Germany Obligations. In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Barnes Germany Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of a Barnes Germany Company, or for any other reason, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents or any other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any Barnes Germany Obligation shall be immediately due and payable by the Guarantor.

In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Barnes Luxembourg Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of a Barnes Luxembourg Company, or for any other reason, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents or any other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any Barnes Luxembourg Obligation shall be immediately due and payable by the Guarantor.
6.Subrogation; Subordination.
6.1.    Waiver of Rights Against Each Company. Until the final payment and performance in full of all of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Guarantor shall not exercise and hereby waives any rights against each Company arising as a result of payment by the Guarantor hereunder, by way of subrogation, reimbursement, restitution, contribution or otherwise, and will not prove any claim in competition with the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party in respect of any payment hereunder in any bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization case or proceedings of any nature; the Guarantor will not claim any setoff, recoupment or counterclaim against any Company in respect of any liability of the Guarantor to such Company; and the Guarantor waives any benefit of and any right to participate in any collateral security which may be held by the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party.
6.2.    Subordination. The payment of any amounts due with respect to any indebtedness of each Company for money borrowed or credit received now or hereafter owed to the Guarantor is hereby subordinated to the prior payment in full of all of the Guaranteed Obligations. The Guarantor agrees that, while any default in the payment or performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations exists, the Guarantor will not demand, sue for or otherwise attempt to collect any such indebtedness of any Company to the Guarantor until all of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been paid in full or such default ceases to exist. If, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Guarantor shall collect, enforce or receive any amounts in respect of such indebtedness while any Guaranteed Obligations are still outstanding, such amounts shall be collected, enforced and received by the Guarantor as trustee for the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties and be paid over to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties, on account of the Guaranteed Obligations, as the case may be, without affecting in any manner the liability of the Guarantor under the other provisions of this Barnes Switzerland Guaranty.

- 5 -
Parties is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, without notice to the Guarantor (any such notice being expressly waived by the Guarantor) and to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply such deposits and other sums against the obligations of the Guarantor under this Barnes Switzerland Guaranty, whether or not the Administrative Agent or such other Credit Party shall have made any demand under this Barnes Switzerland Guaranty and although such obligations may be contingent or unmatured.
8.Further Assurances. The Guarantor agrees that it will from time to time, at the request of the Administrative Agent, do all such things and execute all such documents as the Administrative Agent may consider necessary or desirable to give full effect to this Barnes Switzerland Guaranty and to perfect and preserve the rights and powers of the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties hereunder. The Guarantor acknowledges and confirms that the Guarantor itself has established its own adequate means of obtaining from each Company on a continuing basis all information desired by the Guarantor concerning the financial condition of such Company and that the Guarantor will look to such Company and not to the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party in order for the Guarantor to keep adequately informed of changes in such Company’s financial condition.
9.Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Barnes Switzerland Guaranty, the aggregate liability of the Guarantor under this Barnes Switzerland Guaranty shall be limited to the maximum amount of the Guarantor’s freely disposable shareholder equity available for distribution as dividends to the shareholders of the Guarantor at the time of the start of the proceedings for enforcement of this Barnes Switzerland Guaranty, which amount (i) shall be determined in accordance with Swiss law and on the basis of an audited annual or interim balance sheet of the Guarantor; (ii) shall be approved as distribution by a duly convened meeting of the shareholders of the Guarantor; and (iii) shall be subject to deduction of any applicable Swiss withholding tax.

This Barnes Switzerland Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect until the Administrative Agent is given written notice of the Guarantor’s intention to discontinue this Barnes Switzerland Guaranty, notwithstanding any intermediate or temporary payment or settlement of the whole or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations. No such notice shall be effective unless received and acknowledged by an officer of the Administrative Agent at the address of the Administrative Agent for notices set forth in §16.6 of the Credit Agreement. No such notice shall affect any rights of the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party hereunder, including without limitation the rights set forth in §§4 and 6, with respect to any Guaranteed Obligations incurred or accrued prior to the receipt of such notice or any Guaranteed Obligations incurred or accrued pursuant to any contract or commitment in existence prior to such receipt. This Barnes Switzerland Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, notwithstanding any such notice, if at any time any payment made or value received with respect to any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Company, or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made or value received.
11.Successors and Assigns. This Barnes Switzerland Guaranty shall be binding upon the Guarantor, its successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties and their respective successors, transferees and assigns. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, each Credit Party may assign or otherwise transfer the Credit

Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents or any other agreement or note held by it evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations, or sell participations in any interest therein, to any other entity or other person, and such other entity or other person shall thereupon become vested, to the extent set forth in the agreement evidencing such assignment, transfer or participation, with all the rights in respect thereof granted to such Credit Party herein, all in accordance with §15 of the Credit Agreement.

12.Amendments and Waivers. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Barnes Switzerland Guaranty nor consent to any departure by the Guarantor therefrom shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders.

13.Notices. All notices and other communications called for hereunder shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise specifically provided herein, shall be deemed to have been duly made or given when delivered by hand or mailed first class, postage prepaid, or, in the case of telegraphic or telexed notice, when transmitted, answer back received, addressed as follows: if to the Guarantor, at the address set forth beneath its signature hereto, and if to the Administrative Agent, at the address for notices to the Administrative Agent set forth in §16.6 of the Credit Agreement, or at such address as either party may designate in writing to the other.
14.Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction. THIS BARNES SWITZERLAND GUARANTY SHALL, PURSUANT TO NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW §5-1401, BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

The Guarantor hereby waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such suit or any such court or that such suit was brought in an inconvenient court.
15.Waiver of Jury Trial. THE GUARANTOR AND EACH OF THE BENEFICIARIES OF THIS BARNES SWITZERLAND GUARANTY HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF ANY DISPUTE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS BARNES SWITZERLAND GUARANTY, ANY RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER OR THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY OF SUCH RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS. Except as prohibited by law, the Guarantor hereby waives any right which it may have to claim or recover in any litigation referred to in the preceding sentence any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages or any damages other than, or in addition to, actual damages. The Guarantor (i) certifies that neither the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party nor any representative, agent or attorney of the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waivers and (ii) acknowledges that, in entering into

In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Barnes Switzerland Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of a Barnes Switzerland Company, or for any other reason, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents or any other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any Barnes Switzerland Obligation shall be immediately due and payable by the Guarantor.
6.Subrogation; Subordination.
6.1.    Waiver of Rights Against Each Company. Until the final payment and performance in full of all of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Guarantor shall not exercise and hereby waives any rights against each Company arising as a result of payment by the Guarantor hereunder, by way of subrogation, reimbursement, restitution, contribution or otherwise, and will not prove any claim in competition with the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party in respect of any payment hereunder in any bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization case or proceedings of any nature; the Guarantor will not claim any setoff, recoupment or counterclaim against any Company in respect of any liability of the Guarantor to such Company; and the Guarantor waives any benefit of and any right to participate in any collateral security which may be held by the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party.
6.2.    Subordination. The payment of any amounts due with respect to any indebtedness of each Company for money borrowed or credit received now or hereafter owed to the Guarantor is hereby subordinated to the prior payment in full of all of the Guaranteed Obligations. The Guarantor agrees that, while any default in the payment or performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations exists, the Guarantor will not demand, sue for or otherwise attempt to collect any such indebtedness of any Company to the Guarantor until all of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been paid in full or such default ceases to exist. If, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Guarantor shall collect, enforce or receive any amounts in respect of such indebtedness while any Guaranteed Obligations are still outstanding, such amounts shall be collected, enforced and received by the Guarantor as trustee for the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties and be paid over to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties, on account of the Guaranteed Obligations, as the case may be, without affecting in any manner the liability of the Guarantor under the other provisions of this Barnes Germany Guaranty.
6.3.    Provisions Supplemental. The provisions of this §6 shall be supplemental to and not in derogation of any rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties under any separate subordination agreement which the Administrative Agent may at any time and from time to time enter into with the Guarantor for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties.
7.Setoff. Regardless of the adequacy of any collateral security or other means of obtaining payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, each of the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, without notice to the Guarantor (any such



- 5 -
notice being expressly waived by the Guarantor) and to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply such deposits and other sums against the obligations of the Guarantor under this Barnes Germany Guaranty, whether or not the Administrative Agent or such other Credit Party shall have made any demand under this Barnes Germany Guaranty and although such obligations may be contingent or unmatured.
8.Further Assurances. The Guarantor agrees that it will from time to time, at the request of the Administrative Agent, do all such things and execute all such documents as the Administrative Agent may consider necessary or desirable to give full effect to this Barnes Germany Guaranty and to perfect and preserve the rights and powers of the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties hereunder. The Guarantor acknowledges and confirms that the Guarantor itself has established its own adequate means of obtaining from each Company on a continuing basis all information desired by the Guarantor concerning the financial condition of such Company and that the Guarantor will look to such Company and not to the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party in order for the Guarantor to keep adequately informed of changes in such Company’s financial condition.
9.Limitation. As long as the Guarantor is incorporated under German law as a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung), the Guaranteed Obligations shall be limited as follows:
9.1.    The Guaranteed Obligations shall be limited, if and to the extent (1) they secure obligations of (i) a direct or indirect shareholder or (ii) an affiliated company (verbundenes Unternehmen) of a direct or indirect shareholder of the Guarantor within the meaning of Section 15 of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) (other than any of the Guarantor’s subsidiaries) and (2) that, in such case, the enforcement of the Guaranteed Obligations (i) would cause the Guarantor’s assets (the calculation of which shall include all items set forth in Section 266(2) A, B, C, D and E of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch)) less the Guarantor’s liabilities (the calculation of which shall include all items set forth in Section 266(3) B, C, D and E of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch)), whereby any such determination shall be in accordance with the principles for ordinary bookkeeping and the preparation of balance sheets as they were consistently applied by the Guarantor in preparing its unconsolidated financial statements (Jahresabschluss) according to Section 42 German Limited Liability Companies Act (GmbHG), Sections 242, 246 German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) (the “Net Assets”) to be less than its registered share capital (Stammkapital) (Begründung einer Unterbilanz) or (ii) (if the Guarantor’s Net Assets are already less than its registered share capital) would cause such deficit to be further increased (Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz), and thereby violating the capital maintenance requirements as set out in Sections 30, 31 German Limited Liability Companies Act (GmbHG).
9.2.    For the purposes of such calculation the following balance sheet items shall be adjusted as follows:
(i) the amount of any increase after the date of this Barnes Germany Guaranty of the Guarantor’s registered share capital (Stammkapital) which has been effected without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent shall be deducted from the registered share capital; and
(ii) loans and other liabilities owed by the Guarantor shall be disregarded if and to the extent such loans or other liabilities are subordinated, or are considered subordinated pursuant to



- 6 -
Section 39, paragraph 1, number 5 German Insolvency Code (InsO) or pursuant to Section 39, paragraph 2 German Insolvency Code (InsO); and
(iii) loans and other contractual liabilities incurred in violation of the Credit Agreement shall be disregarded.
9.3.    In addition, the Guarantor shall within three (3) months after a written request of the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party realise, to the extent legally permitted, in a situation where after enforcement of the Guaranteed Obligations the Guarantor would not have Net Assets in excess of its registered share capital, any and all of its assets that are shown in the balance sheet with a book value (Buchwert) that is significantly lower than the market value of the asset if such realisation is commercially justifiable with respect to the costs and efforts involved and, to the extent that any asset is essential for its business, shall only realise such assets if such realisation does not affect the ability of the Guarantor to use that asset or the relevant part of its business can be carried on from other sources without use of such asset.
9.4.    The enforcement of the Guaranteed Obligations shall initially be excluded pursuant to §9.1 if no later than 30 days following a demand by the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party to make a payment under the Guaranteed Obligations, the managing directors on behalf of the Guarantor have confirmed in writing to the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties:
(i) to what extent the Guaranty Obligation is an up-stream or cross-stream guarantee or security as described in §9.1; and
(ii) which amount of such cross-stream and/or up-stream obligation cannot be enforced as it would cause the Net Assets of the Guarantor to be less than its registered share capital (taking into account the adjustments set out in §9.2), and (ii) that the events set out in Section 30, paragraph 1, sentences 2 and 3 German Limited Liability Companies Act (GmbHG) do not apply (the “Management Determination”) and such confirmation is supported by a reasonably satisfactory calculation (including in particular pro forma interim financial statements) provided that the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties shall in any event be entitled to enforce the Guaranteed Obligations for any amounts where such enforcement would, in accordance with the Management Determination, not cause the Guarantor’s Net Assets to be less than (or to fall further below) the amount of its registered share capital (in each case as calculated and adjusted in accordance with §9.1 and §9.2).
9.5.    Following the Administrative Agent’s and the Credit Parties’ receipt of a Management Determination, any further enforcement of the Guaranteed Obligations (i.e. any enforcement to which the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties are not already entitled to pursuant to §9.4) shall be excluded pursuant to §9.1 above for a period of no more than 45 days. If the Administrative Agent and the Credit Parties receive within such 45 days period (i) an up-to date balance sheet together with (ii) a determination, in each case prepared by auditors of international standard and reputation appointed by the Guarantor (the “Auditor”), either confirming the Management Determination or setting out deviations from the Management Determination (the “Auditor’s Determination”), the further enforcement of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be limited, if and to the extent such enforcement would, in accordance with the Auditor’s Determination cause the Guarantor’s Net Assets to be less than (or to fall further below) the amount of its registered share capital in each case as calculated and adjusted in accordance with §9.1 and §9.2 above. If the Guarantor fails to deliver an Auditor’s Determination within



- 7 -
the above 45 day period, the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties shall be entitled to enforce the Guaranteed Obligations without any limitation or restriction.
9.6.    The limitations set out in this §9.1 shall not apply (or, as the case may be, shall cease to apply):
(i) if and to the extent the Guarantor secures any amounts which are lent or on-lent or otherwise passed on, or issued for the account of, or used for the refinancing of amounts on-lent or otherwise passed-on, to the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries from time to time and not repaid to the relevant lending company; or
(ii) if and when, at the time of the intended enforcement of this Barnes Germany Guaranty, a domination agreement (Beherrschungsvertrag) and/or a profit absorption agreement (Gewinnabführungsvertrag) within the meaning of Section 291 of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) (either directly or through a chain of domination and/or profit absorption agreements) is or becomes effective between the Guarantor and:
(a)    in case the Guarantor is a (direct or indirect) subsidiary of the company whose obligations are secured by the Guaranteed Obligations, that company; or
(b)     in case the Guarantor is a sister company of the company whose obligations are secured by the Guaranteed Obligations, any joint (direct or indirect) parent company of the Guarantor and that company
(as dominating entity (beherrschendes Unternehmen)),
except where the existence of such domination agreement (Beherrschungsvertrag) and/or a profit absorption agreement (Gewinnabführungsvertrag) does not result in the inapplicability of sentence 1 of paragraph 1 of Section 30 German Limited Liability Companies Act (GmbHG) with respect to the relevant payments under the Guaranteed Obligations.
9.7.     For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this §9.1 shall be interpreted as a restriction or limitation of the enforcement of the Guaranteed Obligations to the extent such Guaranty Obligation guarantees obligations of the Guarantor itself or obligations of any of its (direct or indirect) subsidiaries including in each case their legal successors or (ii) the enforcement of any claim of the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party against any of the Companies. Notwithstanding any other provision in this §9, the limitation set out in this §9.1 shall not apply if and to the extent an enforcement does not lead to a violation under the rules provided for in Sections 30 et seq. of the German Limited Liability Companies Act (GmbHG), each as applicable from time to time.
The limitation set out in this §9.1 does not affect the rights of the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party to claim again any outstanding amount at a later point in time if and to the extent that §9.1 would allow this at that later point in time.
For the avoidance of doubt, in case of an insolvency of the Guarantor, the limitations as set out in §9.1 shall not limit the amount of the claims of the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party under this Barnes Germany Guaranty which can be filed by the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party against the insolvency estate of the Guarantor (Keine Beschränkung der Anmeldung zur Insolvenztabelle).



- 8 -
10.Termination; Reinstatement. This Barnes Germany Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect until the Administrative Agent is given written notice of the Guarantor’s intention to discontinue this Barnes Germany Guaranty, notwithstanding any intermediate or temporary payment or settlement of the whole or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations. No such notice shall be effective unless received and acknowledged by an officer of the Administrative Agent at the address of the Administrative Agent for notices set forth in §16.6 of the Credit Agreement. No such notice shall affect any rights of the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party hereunder, including without limitation the rights set forth in §§4 and 6, with respect to any Guaranteed Obligations incurred or accrued prior to the receipt of such notice or any Guaranteed Obligations incurred or accrued pursuant to any contract or commitment in existence prior to such receipt. This Barnes Germany Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, notwithstanding any such notice, if at any time any payment made or value received with respect to any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Company, or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made or value received.
11.Successors and Assigns. This Barnes Germany Guaranty shall be binding upon the Guarantor, its successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties and their respective successors, transferees and assigns.

The Guarantor may not assign any of its obligations hereunder.
12.Amendments and Waivers. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Barnes Germany Guaranty nor consent to any departure by the Guarantor therefrom shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders. No failure on the part of the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right.
13.Notices. All notices and other communications called for hereunder shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise specifically provided herein, shall be deemed to have been duly made or given when delivered by hand or mailed first class, postage prepaid, or, in the case of telegraphic or telexed notice, when transmitted, answer back received, addressed as follows: if to the Guarantor, at the address set forth beneath its signature hereto, and if to the Administrative Agent, at the address for notices to the Administrative Agent set forth in §16.6 of the Credit Agreement, or at such address as either party may designate in writing to the other.

The Guarantor hereby waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such suit or any such court or that such suit was brought in an inconvenient court.
15.Waiver of Jury Trial. THE GUARANTOR AND EACH OF THE BENEFICIARIES OF THIS BARNES GERMANY GUARANTY HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF ANY DISPUTE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS BARNES GERMANY GUARANTY, ANY RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER OR THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY OF SUCH RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS. Except as prohibited by law, the Guarantor hereby waives any right which it may have to claim or recover in any litigation referred to in the preceding sentence any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages or any damages other than, or in addition to, actual damages. The Guarantor (i) certifies that neither the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party nor any representative, agent or attorney of the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waivers and (ii) acknowledges that, in entering into the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party is a party, the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties are relying upon, among other things, the waivers and certifications contained in this §15.

The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law or any other agreement, and this Barnes Germany Guaranty shall be in addition to any other guaranty of or collateral security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations.
